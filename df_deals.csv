Founderful, together with German and UK-based VCs as well as specialized angel investors, participated in the startup’s funding round. Alongside lead investor Founderful , mimic robotics seed round attracted further venture capital firms such as another.vc from Germany and Tiny.vc from the UK, and an all-star line-up of specialized angel investors. The funds will accelerate the development of its AI-based robotic arm and humanoid hand solution as the team gears towards the official product launch this year. Founded in 2024 as a spinoff from ETH Zurich, mimic’s researchers Elvis Nava, Stefan Weirich, Stephan-Daniel Gravert and Benedek Forrai are convinced that the latest developments in large-scale generative AI models would upend a multitude of industries, beyond just language and image generation. They developed a foundation model for robotic manipulation, enabling robots to reason and understand the physical world. The downstream effect is that robots can execute tasks with minimal demonstrations and without requiring expensive, complicated programming by engineers for each new task. Currently, the team is developing a dexterous, human-like robotic hands that fit seamlessly into existing manual labor workflows, driven by state-of-the-art AI models trained directly from human demonstrations. The robot will be able to understand and imitate any behavior, simply by watching a human perform it. This should help address the labor shortages in any industry employing workers in repetitive but hard-to-automate tasks involving complex motor skills. “Most use cases are stationary and do not require a full humanoid robot with legs. That’s why we focus data-collection and hardware ingenuity on a universal robotic hand that is compatible with off-the-shelf industrial robotic arms for positioning.” says co-founder Stephan-Daniel Gravert. Unlike conventional solutions where robots are only able to complete the narrowly specific task they are designed for, mimic is developing robots with a unified, general purpose approach to achieve a variety of tasks with a single robot design. “We designed our robot to mimic a human hand so it fits in our world, instead of re-designing the world to fit with our robot,” says co-founder Elvis Nava. With the global market for Humanoid AI and robotics anticipated to reach $38 billion by 2035 , mimic plans to collaborate closely with industry clients to develop solutions for the real world while staying laser-focused on platform-agnostic manipulation and hands rather than building an entire humanoid robot. A wide range of initial customers, from supermarkets, industrial baking and gastronomy to manufacturing, recycling and pharmaceutical lab automation have already approached the startup.

The company has secured $30 million in Series A financing led by founding investor Versant Ventures and a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca that will provide additional, non-dilutive financing of up to $80 million over the next two years. SixPeaks was founded in 2022 at Versant’s Ridgeline Discovery Engine in the Basel Technology Park with the goal of developing improved therapies for healthy weight loss. The SixPeaks team leveraged internal biologics capabilities within Ridgeline to create an activin IIA/B receptor antibody for robust preservation of skeletal muscle mass in humans. GLP-1-based therapies have proven efficacy in obesity and associated co-morbidities. However, patients can lose muscle mass in addition to reductions in body fat, with the decrease in muscle accounting for up to 40% of the weight loss derived from these medicines. Consequently, this can limit the long-term utility of these agents. Preclinical studies of the lead molecules show improved potency, biophysical properties, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, as well as reduced off-target binding compared with competing antibodies. In both lean and obese mouse models, SixPeaks’ lead molecules show potentially best-in-class efficacy for muscle mass preservation both as a single agent and when combined with GLP-1 agonists. The company also has conjugated its activin receptor IIA/B antibody with a GLP-1 peptide, thus creating a first-in-class therapy with the potential to provide maximal GLP-1 agonist-mediated weight-loss while preserving muscle. This conjugation platform is being expanded to develop other incretin-based molecules for weight management and associated co-morbidities. “We are proud to debut SixPeaks, which has developed a pipeline of impactful future medicines for healthy weight loss,” said CEO Philip Larsen. “In addition, we are very excited to be working with AstraZeneca, whose development capabilities and commitment to this space made them our partner of choice.” Under the terms of the collaboration, AstraZeneca participated in the $30 million Series A financing and is committing up to $80 million in capital including upfront and near-term payments. In exchange, AstraZeneca received an option to acquire SixPeaks at an agreed-upon price at the time of submission of an IND application for the biotech’s lead antibody. “Based on our progress over the past 24 months as a stealth company, we believe this pipeline has the potential to produce a new wave of innovative therapies,” said Alex Mayweg, PhD, Managing Director at Versant and Chairperson of SixPeaks’ board of directors. “It is gratifying to be an early mover in creating the next generation of life-changing medicines for cardiometabolic diseases.” (Press release)"

The Zurich-based company closed a Series A funding round led by Swisscom Ventures. One in five workdays is lost to poor mental health, yet companies continue pouring billions into wellness programs that fail to move the needle. Today, Kyan Health announces $16.7M in funding to transform this broken model, combining AI-powered preventive care with organizational insights that help companies treat employee wellbeing as a strategic, measurable investment rather than a box-ticking exercise. The funding comprises a previously unannounced $4M seed round led by Amplo VC and a $12.7M Series A led by Swisscom Ventures , with participation from GreyMatter Capital , naturalX Health Ventures , Founderful , Joyance Partners and several angel investors. This brings Kyan's total funding to $18.4M as it expands its platform globally. Kyan Health was co-founded by Vlad Gheorghiu, Konstantin Struck, and Ignacio Leonhardt. Vlad, a former leader of McKinsey's global mental health program, experienced firsthand the challenges of managing mental health in high-pressure environments. Together with Konstantin, a former Associate Partner at McKinsey & Company, and Ignacio, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Handy.com, they launched Kyan Health with a mission to provide both individualized care and systemic solutions that address organizational needs. While companies globally spend over $94 billion annually on workplace wellbeing initiatives, most programs remain stuck in a reactive model of crisis management. ""Mental health isn't a fluffy perk—it's the backbone of a thriving workforce,"" said Vlad Gheorghiu, CEO and Co-Founder of Kyan Health. ""When I struggled personally, and later when I led a global mental health program, I saw firsthand how inadequate the tools were to address real challenges. This investment is about changing that—creating the tools I wish had existed, making mental health measurable, and giving organizations the power to act before crises hit."" AI-powered enterprise solution Kyan Health provides its services through a subscription-based model for enterprise clients. At the heart of Kyan's platform is Kai, an AI-powered care navigator that connects employees to personalized resources—from crisis support to certified coaching and mental health counseling. The platform operates as a ""trusted third party,"" offering users confidential access to tools with end-to-end encryption. No personal data is shared with employers; only aggregated insights are used to enhance workplace conditions while safeguarding privacy. The impact is already evident among Kyan's enterprise clients. Notable clients like Hitachi Energy, Hilti, STADA, Deutsche Börse Group, and On have already seen tangible results. At On, the Swiss performance sportswear company, Kyan's platform achieved a 50% employee engagement rate and delivered $2.9M in annual value through improved productivity, reduced attrition, and cost savings—representing an 11.6x ROI. ""We decided to work with Kyan, as they are the only provider that truly supports the organizational and individual angle at the same time with an end-to-end solution,"" said Achim Braun, CHRO of Hitachi Energy, responsible for 40,000 employees globally. ""We've been working with Kyan since 2022 and we are excited to continue our partnership!"" ""Kyan Health is transforming how businesses support mental health and well-being by providing predictive, scalable solutions that address the needs of global enterprises. We're excited to back a company that's at the forefront of this shift,"" said Victoria Lietha, Investment Director at Swisscom Ventures, who led the investment and is joining the Kyan Health Board of Directors. While companies routinely apply predictive maintenance to physical assets, they've overlooked their most valuable resource: their people. Kyan Health is changing this paradigm, helping organizations address absenteeism and productivity challenges before they impact the bottom line. This shift from reactive support to strategic investment marks a new era in corporate mental health, where wellbeing becomes a measurable driver of business performance.

Led by Swiss VC, Founderful, the funds will fuel product development and the initiation of pilot projects. Cultivated meat and seafood are rapidly emerging as an appealing option for consumers seeking alternatives. The sector's rising popularity is evident in its statistics , with annual growth exceeding 50% and projections suggesting a market value surpassing $370 billion by 2030. A crucial element in realizing and maximizing this growth potential lies in technological advancements that enhance the texture and expand the range of meat and fish products available to consumers. Nicole Kleger, Simona Fehlmann and Anna Bünter, co-founders of sallea have made it their goal to help manufacturers of cultivated foods accelerate the production of premium whole cuts like steaks and filets without the need for animal farming. Founded in November 2023 after years of research at the ETH Zurich, sallea’s technology enables the creation of precisely structured, edible, and porous 3D grids - so called scaffolds - that serve as the foundation for cultivating textured whole cuts of meat and fish. These scaffolds are added to bioreactors containing cells. These cells will then attach to sallea’s scaffolds and grow in three dimensions into whole cuts thereby improving the nutritional profile and texture of the end product. Manufacturers of cultivated foods will now not only be able to tailor the size and shape but also the nutritional profile of their scaffolds to the end product. The startup has raised a $2.6M pre-seed round led by Founderful with participation from Kost Capital . This marks sallea's first equity investment, building on the $1.8M in non-dilutive funding previously secured through research and start-up grants. The fresh funding allows sallea to accelerate product development and initiate pilot projects with cultivating companies around the globe. ""While the potential of cellular agriculture is clear, scaling it effectively demands not only capital and expertise but also innovative solutions like sallea’s, which enable the production of high-quality products that can accelerate the path to price parity and fully satisfy consumer expectations"" commented Robin Matthew, CEO of Elsa-Group (Migros Industrie), a leading group in the Swiss dairy and alternative protein industry. ""Cultivated foods have been limited to sausages and minced meat. Our technology has the potential to kick-start cellular agriculture by accelerating time to market and lowering the production costs for cultivated whole cuts such as steaks and fillets,"" says Simona Fehlmann, CEO and co-founder of sallea. ""This funding round allows us to advance our mission of setting the industry standard for edible scaffolds in cellular agriculture. We can now upgrade our production capacity, enter partnerships for product co-development, and double down on our development efforts."" James Ryall, ex-Chief Scientific Officer at cultured meat company, Vow , added: ""With cultivated meat now regulated and consumed globally, the industry is poised for its next evolutionary leap. Sallea is at the forefront of this advancement, developing next-generation scaffolds that address two critical challenges: cost reduction and enhanced structural complexity. Sallea's edible scaffolds not only opens the door to premium cultivated meat products with superior texture but also significantly lowers production costs - offering consumers a wider range of high-quality, sustainable protein options.""

This funding will finance the upcoming clinical trial and support the implementation of automated manufacturing processes for Cartibeads, making this treatment accessible to a larger patient population. Co-founded by Vannary Tieng (CEO) and Alessandra de Picciotto (Chairman) in 2018, Vanarix is a Swiss clinical stage startup specializing in regenerative medicine, focusing on articular cartilage regeneration. The company raised this year CHF 4 million in its journey to improve patients’ lives. Addressing Unmet Needs in Cartilage Regeneration Cartilage damage, especially lesions over 2 cm² in the knee, causes significant pain and disability, affecting those who have experienced repetitive trauma, the elderly, and individuals who are overweight. Without effective treatment, these lesions can progress to osteoarthritis, impacting 300 million people worldwide and the only treatment for advanced degeneration is joint replacement (knee or other). Vanarix has developed two revolutionary products: autologous and allogeneic Cartibeads, both currently in clinical trials. Cartibeads are bioengineered cartilage mini-implants capable of self-integrating into lesions and repairing them. These implants resemble native cartilage and enable patients who receive them to return to intensive sporting activity without pain. Allogeneic Cartibeads offer several advantages over autologous Cartibeads, including a single surgical procedure, ready-to-use availability, and lower production costs. Our patented technology for mass cell amplification ensures donor cells can treat thousands of patients Milestones and Clinical Trial Successes Despite being a small team of three, Vanarix has achieved significant milestones since its inception five years ago: Autologous Cartibeads Clinical Study: In its first Phase I/IIa clinical study, ten patients with lesions up to 11.5 cm² received autologous Cartibeads. Preliminary results after six months' follow-up showed significant pain reduction in five patients, with MRI analysis revealing good lesion filling and graft integration. T2 mapping assessed the cartilage quality as closely resembling native tissue. Remarkably, one patient resumed intense sporting activities, including triathlons, just six months post-transplant. Allogeneic Cartibeads in animal studies: Its second-generation allogeneic Cartibeads were successfully used in preclinical studies on minipigs and clinical studies on three young horses with osteochondritis dissecans. Data indicated excellent graft integration with no inflammation or rejection. Notably, one horse returned to competitive show jumping six months post-transplant. Upcoming Clinical Trials and Future Plans A new Phase I/IIa clinical trial will begin on July 17, 2024, with the transplantation of the first two patients with allogeneic Cartibeads at Lugano Hospital under the supervision of Dr. Marco Delcogliano. Three additional sites in Switzerland, including HUG in Geneva (Dr. Philippe Tscholl), Clinic Hirslanden/La Colline (Pr. Jacques Ménétrey), and Balgrist/Zurich (Pr.

The startup has developed a hybrid system that combines wheels and legs, allowing robots to navigate and perform tasks across various terrains. The company has already secured paying customers and a financing round of CHF 3.5 million, pushing it into the commercialisation phase. Swiss-Mile Robotics AG was founded in April 2023 by Marko Bjelonic , Giorgio Valsecchi , Lorenz Wellhausen , Alexander Reske and Marco Hutter following six years of research at the ETH, focusing on integrating artificial intelligence into robots to provide clients with an end-to-end-solution for applications in logistics, monitoring to construction and security. Their approach combines wheels and legs in its robot system, enabling better performance and adaptation to different spaces. These features, coupled with reinforcement learning and supervised learning, further expand the capabilities of four-legged robots, allowing them to better understand their real-world environment with AI. For instance, since robots only need a CE certification, they can be deployed in private areas and almost everywhere on public roads with a safety operator present. In the future, these robots can be fully autonomous on the street with appropriate permissions. Starting with the Unitree Robotics hardware platform, the ETH Spinoff empowers wheeled-legged robots to navigate and perform tasks across diverse environments, including carrying substantial payloads of up to 60 kg, while overcoming obstacles with speed and efficiency. Swiss-Mile has enhanced the capabilities of robots by adding wheels, giving them the ability to switch between driving and walking modes for more flexibility and speed. This enhanced mobility opens avenues to address labour shortages, cut costs, enhance insights, and prioritize safety in workspaces. Currently, Swiss-Miles is in the proof-of-concept and pilot installations stage, and it has attracted paying customers from Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Discussions with potential other customers are ongoing. Building on the successful early pilot deployments and trust from customers, the startup is now set for the official commercialisation of its AI deployed on wheeled-legged robots. In addition to early revenue from pilot projects, Swiss-Mile closed a financing round of 3.5 million USD from investors including Linear Capital , Agile Robots AG , and Sequoia Capital China . The funds will primarily be used to expand the team from the current 10 to 20 members by the end of the year. Additionally, the money will be used to enhance customer value by improving product offerings. (RAN)"

Argá Medtech’s CSE ablation system enables electrophysiologists to treat any region in the heart safely and efficiently using a single, multi-configurable catheter while titrating lesion depths according to the location within the heart. The new funds will enable Argá Medtech to advance the development of its innovative CSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system for treating AF through the execution of an IDE study in the US and a CE Mark study in the EU. The company is based at Biopôle (Lausanne) and San Diego. With the funding, Argá will also expand its US offices in San Diego in anticipation of its US clinical activities. The round was led by the existing investors, Advent Life Sciences (UK) and Earlybird Health (Germany), as well as new investor Gilde Healthcare (the Netherlands) and an undisclosed strategic investor. “We are pleased to secure the support of such marquee investors who believe that Argá Medtech will revolutionize the atrial fibrillation ablation field,” said David Neale, CEO of Argá Medtech who is working out of Lausanne. “This financing enables us to advance toward our goal of validating the CSE PFA system in Europe and the US as we work to deliver a safe, fast, and effective treatment to millions of people affected by cardiac rhythm disorders and atrial fibrillation. We are proud of our accomplishments to date, including conducting a 48-patient first-in-human study in Europe, which demonstrated the high performance of our platform in treating atrial fibrillation.” The company’s CSE PFA platform combines its proprietary CSE PFAgenerator with a multi-configurable catheter to provide unmatched flexibility in AF treatment. Argá Medtech’s CSE system uses a sinusoidal/sine wave, while other PFA platforms are typically powered by square wave energy sources. This approach offers several advantages, such as allowing physicians to configure the energy delivery and titrate the depth to the location in the heart. Additionally, the waveform is delivered through a versatile, all-in-one catheter that can be shaped to create circular, linear, or focal ablation lesions, eliminating the need to perform catheter exchanges to achieve the desired lesion set. Thus, the procedure is simplified, reducing the risk of introducing air bubbles as one catheter is removed and another is reinserted, as well as reducing costs. AF is the most common heart arrhythmia, affecting about 38 million patients worldwide, rendering them five times more likely to have a stroke. While ablation using thermal energy has proven effective in alleviating AF symptoms, higher risks are associated with its use. In contrast, PFA energy delivery offers a tissue-selective, precise ablation of the intended heart tissue while preserving nearby tissues and minimizing the risks of thermal injury, such as those to the esophagus or the phrenic nerve.

With these funds, 8inks plans to scale its already validated and patented production technology. The trillion-dollar battery industry is booming, driven largely by demand for electric vehicles. The challenge: Unlike battery design and materials research, battery manufacturing technology has remained largely unchanged for decades, despite its huge potential. Traditional single-layer manufacturing technology is reaching its limits with new battery designs due to high costs. 8inks overcomes the current challenges in battery technology with its manufacturing platform. On average, cost savings of 30 percent can be achieved. A Revolution in Production Technology 8inks , a spin-off from ETH Zurich, has developed a battery manufacturing process that borrows techniques from the paper and photographic industries. A multi-layer coating process reduces both capital and operating costs. At the same time, the process significantly improves the energy density of the batteries. 8inks thus achieves a balance between production demands and battery power. The patented production technology has already been validated in 8inks' lab and an external test facility. The capital raised in the pre-seed round will be used to quantify the levers of the technology in a pilot plant on an industrial scale.

Index ventures led the round and was joined by General Catalyst, Earlybird, and Founderful . Equipped with new funds, the ETH spinoff will build out its platform capabilities and enhance its enterprise offering. For chocolate giant Lindt , producing the perfect Lindor truffles involves numerous interdependencies, such as the quality of the raw material, humidity, temperature and variations in machine age and local factory infrastructure. To maintain quality while delivering billions of Lindor truffles every year, Lindt relies on EthonAI 's causal AI tools to model the relationship between various physical processes and the quality of the resulting truffles and make suggestions for improvement. Founded in 2021, EthonAI uses advanced AI methods to analyse and improve the quality of manufacturers' products and processes by enabling them to combine process and quality data on a single platform. The recently launched Manufacturing Analytics System (MAS) uses AI to give engineers and managers a 'sixth sense' of what is happening on the factory floor - helping them to spot errors, identify inefficient processes, improve quality and reduce waste by up to 50%. Like a range of AI-driven tools that enhance the capabilities of factory managers and engineers, the MAS creates a real-time picture of what is happening, analyses the causes of problems and predicts what can be done to solve them. ‘Manufacturing is at a critical juncture, and companies that fail to adapt with AI risk falling behind. Factories are producing mountains of data and AI is the key to unlocking insights to drive operational excellence,’ says Julian Senoner, CEO of EthonAI. ‘Global supply chains are trembling, and the EU and US are seeking to rebuild manufacturing capabilities. We’re in the throes of a global rethinking of how manufacturing is done – with digitalization, data and AI at the center. That’s exactly where EthonAI is positioned.’ ‘Factories have truly come “online” in the last few years, with the growth of sensors to measure everything from the temperature of a boiler to the vibration of a motor,’ says Katharina Wilhelm, the partner at Index Ventures who led the investment. ‘But data is only valuable if you can digest it, make sense of it, and use it to drive decisions. That’s where EthonAI comes in – helping you to make sense of the data and quickly spot problems, point to bottlenecks and drive operational excellence overall. It turns the paradigm of manufacturing from a piecemeal and reactive one into an intelligent and proactive one.’ EthonAI already has a diverse customer base of Fortune 500 companies and industry leaders across the globe – including Siemens Smart Infrastructure and Lindt & Sprüngli.The team will now focus on deploying resources to grow its platform capabilities and expand its enterprise offering to meet the needs of customers already scaling the MAS across multiple factories.

The funding round is led by Emerald Technology Ventures and Yttrium, with additional funds from BMW i Ventures, the independent venture capital firm of BMW Group. ETH Zurich spin-off Embotech has already secured landmark multi-year rollout contracts for its AVM solution in finished vehicle logistics and its ATT solution for port and yard logistics applications. For its AVM business, Embotech has signed a multi-year contract with automaker BMW to install its solution in six passenger car factories worldwide by the end of 2025. Embotech is the only vendor in the market with a certified AVM solution and the only player with experience in a production environment. For its ATT business, Embotech is gearing up for a major rollout in Europe's largest port, the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, with 30 units set to be deployed over the next 2 years. The electric ATTs are equipped with Embotech’s Level 4 Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Kit, which enables them to operate autonomously in complex, mixed traffic situations. Embotech’s autonomous tractors use a combination of LIDAR, cameras, and GPS to detect obstacles in all weather conditions and achieve localization accuracy of less than 5 cm. Following rigorous testing, which validated the reliability and safety of the technology in the 24/7 port environment, the ATTs are now poised for deployment, enabling seamless horizontal transport of containers across transfer points within the port environment. Embotech leverages shared technology and safety processes across its two business units, resulting in significant efficiencies. This streamlined approach allows for faster innovation and a leaner operation compared to competitors. In both logistics applications, Embotech’s autonomous driving solutions deliver substantial benefits. They substantially increase operational efficiency through 24-hour operation, flexible peak handling, and improved transparency with digital integration. By automating critical processes, Embotech thereby also advances logistics safety. Additionally, these highly automated solutions address the global driver shortage, reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and CO2 emissions, and provide a glimpse into the future of modern logistics. Embotech has closed a Series B funding round led by Emerald Technology Ventures and Yttrium and joined by BMW i Ventures , Nabtesco Technology Ventures , Sustainable Forward Capital Fund , and RKK VC . “Embotech’s offering is an ideal way for companies to accelerate their path to reliable autonomy,” says Mehran Zaker, Partner at Emerald and new Board member at Embotech. “We are excited to support Embotech, a Swiss technology company leading the development of level 4 AV for logistics applications worldwide.” “We are thrilled to announce the successful completion of our Series B funding round, a testament to the growing confidence in Embotech's mission to revolutionize logistics automation,"" said Andreas Kyrtatos, Embotech’s CEO. ""This investment brings an incredible group of new investors on board. It enables us to expand our global presence and deliver leading-edge technology, empowering industrial logistics to transition towards a safer, more efficient, and sustainable future.” “Embotech impressed us with their unique, highly adaptable autonomous logistics solution,” says Dr. Axel Krieger, Partner at Yttrium. “The company tackles the global logistics challenge for both commercial and passenger vehicles. With a strong orderbook as well as proven industry partnerships, Embotech is uniquely positioned to lead the market. An investment that aligns perfectly with Yttrium’s goal to empower tomorrow’s B2B technology champions."" “We are particularly proud of our investment in Embotech, as the company has been pioneering automated vehicle marshalling as part of its successful partnership with the BMW Group since 2022,” adds Marcus Behrendt, Managing Partner at BMW i Ventures. “The technology has the potential to fundamentally change the vehicle production process.

Das Medtech-Startup Spirecut hat mit gut 370'000 Franken die Hälfte seines Sammelziels erreicht. Auch die Startups Jaeger Fishing, Localfish sowie Changemaker haben ihre Finanzierungsschwellen kurz nach Kampagnen-Start bereits übertroffen. Das 2020 von Chris Velkovski und Daniel Dmitriouk gegründete Boxing- und Fitness-Startup Lucky Punch hat über die Plattform Oomnium über 715'000 Franken an frischem Kapital von 128 neuen Investorinnen und Investoren eingesammelt. Damit vergrössern die Zürcher den Kreis der 200 bestehenden Aktionärinnen und Aktionären. Das Wachstumskapital setzt Lucky Punch für die Eröffnung neuer Standorte, die Steigerung der Markenbekanntheit in der Schweiz sowie international und die weitere Verbesserung des Serviceangebots ein. Zudem will das Jungunternehmen bis Ende 2025 ein skalierbares Franchise-Modell umsetzen. Erste Anfragen von interessierten Franchise-Nehmern für Fitnessstudio-Eröffnungen in Mailand, Kapstadt, Saudi-Arabien, Stockholm oder deutschen Städten sind bereits eingetroffen. Lucky Punch erreicht in seinen Studios in Zürich und Dubai durchschnittlich eine Fitnessgruppen-Auslastung von 73 Prozent und monatlich rund 5'000 Kursteilnehmerinnen und -Teilnehmer. Im August 2024 verzeichnete Lucky Punch year-to-date ein Umsatzwachstum von 32 Prozent. Beim Flagship-Studio in Zürich konnte das Startup sein Monatsumsatz in nur 14 Monaten von 59'000 auf 156'000 Franken steigern. Spirecut steht bei Hälfte des Sammelziels Das Medtech-Startup Spirecut wurde 2020 in der Schweiz von Chirurgen gegründet und entwickelt Sono-Instrumente für ultraschallgeführte, inzisionsfreie Operationen zur Behandlung des Karpaltunnelsyndroms und des Triggerfingers. Die ersten patentierten Produkte kamen Anfang 2024 auf den Markt. Spirecut verfügt über FDA-, CE- und ISO-Zertifizierungen und vertreibt seine Instrumente nebst der Schweiz auch in Irland, Grossbritannien, den USA und Kanada. Derzeit sammelt Spirecut über die Plattform Capital Cell frisches Kapital ein und hat mit 370'000 Franken bereits die Hälfte des Sammelziels erreicht. Mit dem zusätzlichen Kapital will das Medtech seine globale Präsenz weiter ausbauen und die Entwicklung neuer Produkte vorantreiben. LocalFish und Jaeger Fishing knacken Finanzierungsschwelle Das 2020 gegründete Startup Localfish betreibt aktuell drei innovative Fischzucht-Anlagen. Das fünfköpfige Co-Gründer-Team hat ein Indooraquakultur-System entwickelt, welches so aufgebaut ist, dass das Wasser fast komplett ständig im geschlossenen Kreislauf bleibt. Der Grund dafür ist die Wasserreinigung, welche durch Bakterien erfolgt. Auch die beim Verarbeiten der Fische anfallenden Reste werden weiterverwendet – aus ihnen entsteht hochwertiges Hundefutter. Jetzt ist Localfish auf der Suche nach zusätzlichem Wachstumskapital bei der Crowd: Über die Plattform Conda hat das Startup mit Sitz im Zürcherischen Rafz bereits kurz nach Kampagnen-Start die Finanzierungsschwelle überschritten. Derzeit haben 155 Investorinnen und Investoren über 273'000 Franken zugesagt. In den verbleibenden gut 10 Tagen wird nun das Sammelziel von einer halben Million Franken anvisiert. Die von Localfish gezüchteten Fische werden bereits in über 100 Filialen der Migros an der Frischetheke verkauft. Weitere Produkte wie Fischknusperli verkauft das Jungunternehmen auch über den eigenen Webshop. Ebenfalls um Fische dreht sich das Geschäftsmodell JAEGER Fishing . Das Zürcher Startup hat für die Erweiterung seiner Fischer-Boxen-Palette und weitere Expansion bereits diesen Frühling über 300'000 Franken bei der Crowd eingesammelt. Mit diesem frischen Kapital hat JAEGER seine Expansion in europäischen Märkten vorangetrieben und ein Distributionsnetzwerk mit über 50 Partnern aufgebaut. Mittlerweile liegt das jährliche Umsatzwachstum bei 110 Prozent. Nun läuft eine weitere Kampagne über Conda . Das Zürcher Jungunternehmen hat dabei 13 Tage vor dem Ende gut 200'000 Franken bei über 90 Investorinnen und Investoren eingesammelt. Das frische Kapital soll die bereits gestartete Expansion in die USA unterstützen und den Ausbau der Produktionskapazität ermöglichen. Changemaker sammelt Geld für Tech-Schub Die auf den Verkauf von nachhaltigen Produkten fokussierte Retail-Kette Changemaker sammelt ebenfalls über die Plattform Conda frisches Kapital bei seiner Crowd. Derzeit sind so über 143'000 Franken von 87 Investorinnen und Investoren zusammengekommen. Mit dem zusätzlichen Eigenkapital will der 2010 gestartete Retailer in Online-Technologie und Kundenbindungs-Aktivitäten wie etwa ein Loyalty-Programm investieren. Zusätzliche Verkaufsflächen kann die 10 Läden umfassende Kette aus dem Cashflow finanzieren. Mit der Unterstützung durch Neo-Investorinnen und Investoren kann Changemaker jedoch die Entwicklung von eigenen Produkten, insbesondere der neuen Produktmarke “Fèir”, schneller voranzutreiben. Das erlaube es dem Unternehmen in Zukunft sogar Monobrand-Stores zu eröffnen. (Fabienne Roos)"

Lausanne-based CREAL announces a license agreement with ZEISS with the aim to create a digitized vision care platform that hopes to revolutionize the current vision diagnostic and treatment procedures. By leveraging CREAL’s light field display technology, ZEISS will bring to market devices that allow for the digital examination of eye conditions as well as virtual simulation of classic ophthalmic lenses, contact lenses, and the like. Ultimately, the partnership should help bring century-old vision test procedures into the 21st century, finally enabling fast, cost-effective and above all user-friendly diagnostic procedures. Many of today’s refraction tests are time-consuming, costly and can even seem intimidating. Manual and lens-based, they rely on outdated technology. As well as all eye care practitioners, these constraints affect a great part of the population. For instance, more than two-thirds of the population in the US wear glasses or contacts, while myopia is constantly growing and is expected to affect 50% of the global population by 2050. The need for intuitive, accurate, effective, and cost-efficient vision tests and diagnosis is therefore only to become even more crucial. Innovating in digital diagnosis for eye defects Through the integration of CREAL’s light field display into vision test devices, ZEISS expects to introduce a groundbreaking solution allowing for precise digital diagnosis of eye defects. By replicating real-world light to provide digital imagery with genuine depth, CREAL’s true 3D display will enable the digital replication of any physical or theoretical lens, allow test procedures to be tailored to any age group/customer segment, as well as enable the projection of automated content, limiting the need for clinical resources overall. “As the pioneer of scientific optics, ZEISS’ mission has always been to challenge the limits of human imagination,” says Antia Alonso Ph.D., Vice President of Zeiss Vision Technology Solutions. “We see our collaboration with CREAL and the consequent development and rollout of our digitized vision care platform as a way to revolutionize the prescription eyewear customer buying experience, elements of which still rely on antiquated technology, developed over a century ago.” Looking ahead, the synergy between ZEISS’ expertise in vision care and eyewear, and CREAL’s cutting-edge advancements in display technology could help accelerate the development of vision-health and vision enhancement enterprise in all its forms, both real and virtual. In addition to the license agreement, CREAL closed a Series B financing . The round was led by Carl Zeiss Vision International GmbH. (PR - ES)"

The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. Online media has become fragmented, the user-onboarding process is tiresome and time-consuming. This is negatively impacting both user engagement levels and media income. The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. Tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users and increase customer spending and engagement. Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, ""The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."" The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure. Tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. Tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.” (Press release / SK)"

The investment positions Lakera to lead the real-time GenAI application security category. While it is estimated that 80% of enterprises will have deployed GenAI applications in production environments, the challenge remains how to secure these applications against AI-specific risks since GenAI introduces new attack methods, including prompt and data poisoning attacks, which can exploit the model to take unintended actions. Based in Zurich and San Francisco, Lakera is at the forefront of AI safety and security to fill this gap. Founded in 2021 by David Haber, Mateo Rojas-Carulla and Matthias Kraft, Lakera developed Lakera Guard, a real-time GenAI security solution that empowers developers to activate this vulnerability data with one line of code, instantly embedding a security layer into AI applications in production. By inserting a single API call in their applications, customers centralize AI security, whereby security teams can set application-specific policies and address emerging threats without developers making any changes to their GenAI model and applications. The solution is powered by a proprietary database that combines over 50 million data points generated by Gandalf – Lakera’s viral AI education game played by over half a million users and thousands of organizations worldwide, including Microsoft, where it's used in security training – with open-source databases and its own dedicated research. Gandalf generates real-time AI threat data that grows by tens of thousands of unique new attacks every day. With companies like Dropbox and a top-three US bank amongst its customers and hundreds of enterprises proactively reaching out to get protected, Lakera is a sought after security solutions provider. The company has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Atomico , with participation from Citi Ventures , Dropbox , and existing investors, including redalpine and the participation from the venture arms of a major financial services firm and an iconic SaaS company, underscoring the urgency and importance of securing GenAI applications for enterprises.

The secured funds of CHF 10.5 million ($12 million) will support the company in becoming the world’s first insurance company with a carbon credit balance sheet. Almost half of the world’s top 2,000 companies have plans to hit net zero emissions by 2030, part of an accelerating effort to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal of global net zero by 2050. Many of these companies, alongside thousands of others, depend on carbon credits to reach their net zero goals. But after considerable turbulence in carbon credit markets, credit integrity, proper risk underwriting and certainty of outcomes are critical to reassure investors, regulators, and other stakeholders that these promises represent real environmental gains. CarbonPool , incorporated in 2023 by former Allianz executives Coenraad Vrolijk, Nandini Wilcke and Frederic Olbert, aims to accelerate investment in carbon credits by providing carbon credit insurance with claims payments made in-kind. This form of insurance covers the failure to achieve net zero commitments due to shortfalls, reversals, business interruptions, and natural catastrophes that either reduce the amount of carbon dioxide removal contracted for or unintentionally add carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Its target customers are corporate investors, fund managers or project managers seeking to de-risk their carbon investments and accelerate the transition to net zero. “CarbonPool’s in-kind payments make it unique among insurers in not only offering protection to holders of carbon credits in cases of natural disaster or technology breakdown but also in providing a guarantee that carbon credits live up to their promises, giving purchasers certainty and ensuring that they can meet their net zero goals,” said Coenraad Vrolijk, former regional CEO of Allianz Africa and CarbonPool’s co-founder and chief executive. The freshly obtained funds will help the startup accelerate its mission of becoming the first company to underwrite the carbon credit markets, with carbon credits and not cash.

With CHF 10 million already invested in 41 startups, the Fund is activly working towards growing its portfolio to 70 companies this year. Kickfund Ventures Fund I is a new investment fund dedicated to enhancing Switzerland's innovation ecosystem by supporting deep tech startups that have successfully participated in the Venture Kick competition. With an initial closing of CHF 70 million, the fund aims to provide up to CHF 850,000 in funding per company, specifically targeting pre-seed and seed-stage ventures. While the Fund typically aims to invest in up to 25 startups per year, this year was an exception due to a backlog of 91 companies from previous Venture Kick ventures, dating as far back as 2021, which were considered for investment once the Fund became operational at the end of 2023. “The objective is to clear this backlog and enter the next phase of normal investment pace matching Venture Kick's ongoing turnout of Venture Kick stage 3 winners starting 2025”, clarified Wanja Humanes, CEO of KickFund. He added, “We are confident that our portfolio will grow to around 70 companies by the end of the year.” However, the fund’s investment strategy is highly systematic, not automatic. Each decision is made with careful consideration, and the fund reserves the right to decline investments when necessary, as evidenced by its recent choice to pass on two opportunities.

The newly created Coresystems FSM AG is a carve-out of Coresystems AG which continues to exist as an independent company. SAP will integrate Coresystems AI based crowd service platform to help organizations find available field-service technicians. (Updated) Field service has become not only a critical factor when it comes to the overall customer experience, but a key competitive differentiator in many industries, including discrete manufacturing, industrial machinery, medical equipment, telecommunications, utilities, and home and office appliances. However, creating and managing an agile, high-performing field service organization is a huge challenge. To overcome these challenges, SAP has acquired Coresystems FSM AG, a carve-out of Coresystems AG, the pioneer in crowd service and a leading field service management platform. Coresystems,which was established in 2006 in the Canton of Aargau, developed a cloud platform that uses Artificial Intelligence to match qualified internal and external technicians to incoming service requests, based on skills, location, and availability. The platform will become part of the SAP Service Cloud portfolio for advanced scheduling of field service activities in real time, and easy-to-use mobile apps that enable service technicians in the field to perform installation, maintenance, and repair tasks. The acquisition will allow the two companies to combine their solutions to extend the vision of the intelligent enterprise to customer service. The newly merged platform will enable SAP customers to create a flexible and powerful service ecosystem with internal experts and external resources, including experienced freelance technicians. The new solution will allow them to respond faster to their customers’ service needs, lower the cost of service, and support entirely new business models. For instance, with predictive maintenance capabilities from SAP, field service resources and the needed replacement parts can now be scheduled and dispatched ahead of time to perform the required tasks even before a product breaks or equipment fails. This will help significantly minimize downtime and increase customer satisfaction. And ad-hoc requests from consumers can be met in real time using the expansive service ecosystem. After the carve-out, Coresystems AG remains an independent Swiss company that is positioned as a global service provider for digital service processes.

RhyGaze was founded on intellectual property exclusively licensed to the company by the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB), a scientific institute led by Director Botond Roska, who is a scientific co-founder of RhyGaze. Incorporated in May 2024, the company is focused on developing gene therapies for retinal diseases causing blindness. Cones are the retinal cells responsible for high acuity vision and can lose their sensitivity to light in a range of diseases. RhyGaze’s gene therapy solution delivers a new light-sensor gene specifically to cone cells that have lost light sensitivity, repairing their ability to detect light. The company has raised CHF 86 million in a new financing round led by GV ( Google Ventures ), alongside Arch Venture Partners , F-Prime Capital and founding investors BioGeneration Ventures and Novartis Venture Fund , which contributed USD 11 million to an earlier seed round. This funding will enable further development of RhyGaze’s lead clinical candidate. Activities to be supported include formal pharmacology and toxicology testing, a non-interventional, observational study to assess potential clinical endpoints in patient groups eligible for the therapy and a first-in-human clinical trial to test the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of the lead candidate. “This program exemplifies a key goal of IOB: combining our deep understanding of retinal biology and vision with breakthrough technologies to develop novel therapies for vision loss,” said Dr. Roska. Added Bence György, M.D., Ph.D., a group leader at the IOB, RhyGaze scientific co-founder and board member and Assistant Professor at the University of Basel: “We are excited to see this program moving forward because it uniquely presents the opportunity to restore high-resolution vision in blind patients.” The Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB) was founded by the University of Basel, the University Hospital Basel and Novartis in December 2017. IOB unites fundamental and clinical researchers.

The established sales network from XING also allows us to be able to offer EQIPIA in one fell swoop throughout the D-A CH area.""Employee recommendations are on the rise in human resources.In the United States, around 40 percent of all new hires are already due to recommendations from their own employees.In the D-A CH area, too, employee recommendations are already the most effective channel of recruiting.Most companies rely on self -developed bonus models to use recommendations from their own employees to fill open spots.However, these are manual processes that are extremely inefficient and time -consuming for both the employee and for the HR department.With the ""EQIPIA recommendation manager"", this complex process is digitized and thus automated.Because the network of employees is transparent via their XING profile, the suitable colleagues are identified using a matching algorithm.Their address is done automatically via the tool and therefore with significantly reduced effort for the HR department.The employee receives all important information about the open position and can then make his contacts comfortably aware of them.HR departments receive transparent reports to the success of this recruitment channel.In addition, you also have the option of excluding a bonus in the event that contact is successfully conveyed.Xing CEO Thomas Vollmoeller: ""An automated solution to employee recommendations is the royal discipline of the personnel search. The advantage for the companies: You get more qualified candidates at the same time-and in a much lesser time-in a much shorter time.

The young social enterprise based in Geneva has raised $320K in a seed round and has over 140K Facebook fans. Over the last ten years, web technology has revolutionized the way everything works and people connect. Think about it. From search, to shopping, to rating hotels and connecting with friends, the World Wide Web has changed the world. Today, thanks to web and mobile technologies, our generation finally has the power and the opportunity to channel all the information in the world and communicate and organize globally. That said, with over 2.5 billion people on the Internet and 6 billion mobile subscriptions, it seems odd that the real issues like poverty, world peace and climate change remain comparatively unaddressed. Today, though traditional media and social networks like twitter inform the world, the world unfortunately remains, with a few exceptions, uninvolved. After witnessing a polio outbreak in Afghanistan, an earthquake in Haiti, a drought in Somalia, a dolphin massacre in Japan, or genocide in Darfur, most people do not know what to do and carry on with their lives. That’s why Endignorance was born. At Endignorance, a young social enterprise based in Geneva, Switzerland, the heart of the international community, a new web platform is being developed to directly address social issues ranging from climate change to poverty by providing easy access to information and a one-click gateway to jobs, internships, campaigns, petitions, fundraisers and other opportunities to get involved and make a real concrete difference. “We believe that by bridging the information gap between knowing and doing, more people will do, and that those doing, will do better,” says Omar Bawa, Founder. The core team behind Endignorance consists of two brothers, Omar and Taha Bawa, and a close friend, Marcus Bonalumi. Thanks to a partnership with Connect Lanka, over 80 content generators worked with Endignorance to build one of the largest handpicked databases in the social sector: over 26K pages in a couple of months. Endignorance has outsourced part of web development to Sri Lanka and the platform’s design to Sweden. The initiative placed third in the first Global Entrepreneurship Week’s “Best Idea Competition” hosted by the United Nations, venturelab and unitec at the University of Geneva. A couple of months later, Endignorance raised $320K in its Seed Round and the founders, Omar and Taha Bawa, spoke at TEDx events in Geneva and Colombo and Google Business Group Talks. When Endignorance launched its beta site online after hosting a large event at the University of Geneva titled “Get Informed. Get Involved.” 100K fans on Facebook welcomed it . Key leaders like Francesco Pisano, the Head of Research at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and its Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) have embraced the initiative. “Initiatives like Endignorance are important to facilitate the access by younger generations to the international discussion on global challenges”, says Francesco Pisano. Though the platform is still in beta, Endignorance has been named the official social media partner for the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy. To accelerate progress, the initiative will soon raise a Series A Round."

The student-led venture capital firm Founderful Campus , established to help students at Swiss universities unlock opportunities in the tech startup ecosystem, invests CHF 25,000 in each selected venture. Receiving this funding boost reinforces startups’ ambitions, allowing them to advance their solutions as they prepare for larger rounds. During the Autumn semester of 2023, the fund invested in six startup projects, three of which were announced earlier this year . The new additions have just been announced and these are: K2 Photonics is an ETH Zurich spinoff that designs and develops an ultrafast laser called dual-comb laser that allows for producing two laser beams from a single optical cavity. By cancelling out disturbances from the environment, the technology allows the precision of optical frequency combs to be harnessed with a simpler and more cost-effective laser setup. This technology is envisioned to power the next generation of laser inspection hardware, which can be used to measure ultra-precise 3D profiles of industrial parts, thicknesses of functional coatings, semiconductor microchips, and even gas compositions in the air. Margaux Kobelt acted as deal captain. Studyflash built an AI-powered tool that automates the creation of flashcards from users’ slides, notes, or other study materials, eliminating the need for manual creation. With their approach, the startup also optimizes study plans through features like active recall and spaced repetition, helping users achieve better knowledge retention, hence helping users save time and enhance their learning experience. The project had Teresa Urban as deal captain. csky.ai secured funding to advance its privacy-focused AI technology for enhancing and securing confidential human conversations such as from medical consultations or board meetings, where traditional cloud-based AI services pose risks of data breaches. Founded in 2022, the EPFL startup developed the plug-and-play device - ClearMind, embedded with a smart microphone - that processes data locally on the device, rather than relying on remote cloud servers, ensuring that sensitive conversational data remains within the room and is not transmitted to external servers. This approach improves privacy and security. The deal captain was Hyeyoung Eléonore Sun.

On the first trading day the shares closed up 42.5% to $24.23. Vectiv is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for severe rare conditions. - updated - Although VectivBio was founded only In 2019, the company has already one product candidate in Phase III clinical trials. Apraglutide is a therapeutic for a range of rare gastrointestinal diseases, with an initial focus on short bowel syndrome, or SBS. Two months ago VectivBio had announced that the first patient has been dosed in its pivotal phase 3 trial of apraglutide in SBS. The fast development was possible, because VectivBio was founded through a spin-off of the apraglutide program from Therachon Holding AG, a rare disease focused company, following its acquisition by Pfizer for an upfront payment of $340 million and additional milestone payments of up to $470 million. Therachon's former chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief medical officer and chief business officer joined the executive team of the spin-out. Before the IPO the company has raised approximately $144 million in private financings from leading biotechnology investors. On Friday the Basel-based company went public on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On Tuesday Vectiv announced the closing of its initial public offering of 8,625,000 ordinary shares, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 1,125,000 ordinary shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $146.6 million. All of the ordinary shares were offered by Vectiv. VectivBio is the fourth Swiss biotech company that went public this year on Nasdaq joining NLS Pharmaceutics, Pharvaris and Gain Therapeutics. Vectiv’s current product pipeline is focused on rare gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders. Based on preclinical and clinical data to date, apraglutide has – according to the company - the potential to advance the treatment of SBS intestinal failure, or SBS-IF, by establishing less frequent dosing and improve clinical outcomes. Currently being evaluated in a global Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF, apraglutide’s therapeutic potential in additional rare GI conditions, such as graft versus host disease, will be also evaluated. In addition, the company intends to license or acquire additional transformational, differentiated rare disease assets. Vectiv’s goal is to build a leading, fully integrated global rare disease company. (Stefan Kyora)"

In addition, ObsEva reported about the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial of its lead product OBE001. ObsEva SA is a Swiss biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy. The announcement of the IPO is being made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The timing and the terms of this initial public offering have not yet been determined. In addition ObsEva announced the results of its IMPLANT clinical trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE001 (nolasiban) for the improvement of clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing embryo transfer (ET) following in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of OBE001, an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, compared to placebo. In the trial population of 247 patients, the percentage of women with a clinical pregnancy (defined as an intra-uterine pregnancy with positive embryo heart beat at six weeks after ET) was increased by over an absolute 9 percent and live birth rates were increased by 10.4 percent (actual live birth rates were 39.6 percent and 29.2 percent for patients treated with OBE001 and patients who received placebo, respectively). While the trial did not achieve its pre-defined primary endpoint of a statistically significant dose-response trend on the percentage of women with clinical pregnancy (powered at 80 percent to detect an absolute difference of 20 percent between placebo and ascending doses of OBE001), ObsEva believes the results were clinically meaningful and equivalent to a 26 percent increase relative to placebo. The lack of a statistically significant dose-response appears to be primarily due to an imbalance in the 300 mg dose group, in the number of the patients who had a high progesterone level at baseline relative to the other arms. ObsEva believes that high progesterone levels can be a possible negative predictive factor for live birth. In a post-hoc analysis that excluded patients with a progesterone level in the top quartile of the patient pool, a statistically significant relationship between the dose of OBE001 and the ongoing clinical pregnancy at week 10 (trend test p-value = 0.035) and live birth rates was identified (trend test p-value = 0.025). In addition, a live birth rate of 51.0 percent was recorded in patients who received a 900 mg dose of OBE001 compared to 30.6 percent in the placebo group. This was the highest observed live birth rate in the trial and equivalent to a 67 percent increase relative to placebo. OBE001 was well tolerated in all dose groups. “We are encouraged by the meaningful increase in pregnancy and live birth rates observed in patients treated with OBE001, particularly in women with normal progesterone levels at the time of embryo transfer,” said Ernest Loumaye, MD, PhD and CEO and co-Founder of ObsEva. “We believe that if confirmed in larger trials, this would represent a major breakthrough for improving the success rate of IVF, a procedure more and more frequently used to address the need of the growing number of couples seeking treatment for infertility.” Based on the results of the IMPLANT trial, ObsEva intends to initiate in Europe a Phase 3 clinical trial in women undergoing IVF. The European Phase 3 trial, which ObsEva will refer to as IMPLANT-2, is planned to start in the first half of 2017."

With CHF 10 million already invested in 41 startups, the Fund is activly working towards growing its portfolio to 70 companies this year. Kickfund Ventures Fund I is a new investment fund dedicated to enhancing Switzerland's innovation ecosystem by supporting deep tech startups that have successfully participated in the Venture Kick competition. With an initial closing of CHF 70 million, the fund aims to provide up to CHF 850,000 in funding per company, specifically targeting pre-seed and seed-stage ventures. While the Fund typically aims to invest in up to 25 startups per year, this year was an exception due to a backlog of 91 companies from previous Venture Kick ventures, dating as far back as 2021, which were considered for investment once the Fund became operational at the end of 2023. “The objective is to clear this backlog and enter the next phase of normal investment pace matching Venture Kick's ongoing turnout of Venture Kick stage 3 winners starting 2025”, clarified Wanja Humanes, CEO of KickFund. He added, “We are confident that our portfolio will grow to around 70 companies by the end of the year.” However, the fund’s investment strategy is highly systematic, not automatic. Each decision is made with careful consideration, and the fund reserves the right to decline investments when necessary, as evidenced by its recent choice to pass on two opportunities. With the goal of aligning closely with Venture Kick, the fund has accelerated its activities this year, rapidly expanding its portfolio to 41 companies across 42 investments. Notably, 38 startups have received funding within this year alone. About CHF 10 million has flown into the portfolio. Luya Foods has received funding twice, benefitting from the maximum amount of CHF 850'000 per company, and two other companies are already in the process of a second investment from the fund.

The Series A2 round is co-led by Union Square Ventures and Steel Atlas. Founded on 29 July 2019, Geneva based Transmutex is reinventing nuclear energy with the design of a safer, non-self-sustaining reaction technology that will usher in a new era of lower-cost and proliferation-resistant, carbon-free baseload energy. Coupling a particle accelerator to a non-self-sustaining (subcritical) fuel assembly has several key benefits over self-sustaining nuclear energy solutions: The reaction can be stopped in 2 milliseconds for safer operation The system can use different fuel material and enrichment levels, thereby unlocking vast resources, including thorium, a metal that has long been overlooked for nuclear energy Subcriticality offers a much wider safety margin, allowing the system to burn the existing stockpile of long-lived nuclear waste more efficiently When thorium is used as fuel, it will not produce plutonium and other long-lived waste When combined with innovative spent-fuel recycling technology, the system can be made sustainable for energy production over centuries The technology's key promises are inherent safety, resistance to proliferation, and the transmutation of long-lived nuclear waste produced by uranium-based nuclear. Transmutex is collaborating with top tier governmental institutions worldwide to explore the possibility of forming of an international coalition to accelerate the development and the construction of a first-of-kind facility. The United Nations recognizes that up to five times more nuclear power will be needed by 2050 to meet the clean energy demand , which is not sustainable, since the current uranium-based nuclear will soon face resource shortage and produces long-lived waste that is difficult to manage. This was further emphasized during COP28, where 22 countries vowed to triple their production of nuclear power. Transmutex selected Union Square Ventures and Steel Atlas , based in New York, to co-lead its Series A2 financing based on their exceptional track-record and demonstrated commitment to investing in impactful deep technology solutions. They are joined by a syndicate of both new and existing investors including At One Ventures (USA), HCVC (France/USA) and AlleyCorp (USA), with the participation of House Of Ventures (USA), Presight Capital (USA), Verve Ventures (Switzerland), FONGIT (Switzerland) and Tiny Supercomputer Investment Co.

The investment round was led by RH Capital with participation from notable co-investors including the Zürcher Kantonal ban k and New York City-based venture firm The Helm. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , there are an estimated 374 million new infections every year , including four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) , namely c hlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. Very often these infections remain asymptomatic, leading to their rapid spread . Moreover, individuals suspect ing having the infection, shy away from seeking an examination due t o the stigma attached to STIs and high cost of traditional tests . Left untreated, STIs can cause dire health complications, including neurological and cardiovascular disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, increased risk of HIV and certain cancers. Biopôle-based Testmate Health has developed a low-cost, over-the-counter diagnostic urine test for STIs with the initial focus on chlamydia and gonorrhea , which are two of the top infective causes of infertility worldwide. Upon buying the self-test kit, the user collects a sample, which is analysed at home . Re sults are delivered w ithin 30 minutes , hence eliminating the need for m edical visits, while granting privacy and convenience . In the case of a positive diagnosis , the us er is directly connected to a healthcare professional for a consultation & prescription .

Until now, USD-denominated stablecoins have dominated, accounting for over 99.5% of the $180 billion in circulating stablecoins, which reflects the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. The extent of its dominance on the blockchain is, however, disproportionately high compared to traditional financial markets. In traditional finance, the euro accounts for about 21% of global foreign exchange reserves and holds a similar share in international debt and SWIFT payment volumes. Yet, euro-denominated stablecoins represent less than 0.3% of the circulating supply and an even smaller fraction of trading volumes. Schuman Financial , with a distributed team worldwide, is developing technologies, infrastructure, and products to bring European financial services on-chain. Their flagship product, EURØP, a Euro-backed stablecoin designed to facilitate digital on-chain FX trading, DeFi use cases, digital payments and to serve as a reliable unit of account. EURØP is pegged 1:1 to the euro and fully backed by cash and cash equivalents, providing stability and reliability for your digital finance. Schuman is fully MiCA-compliant (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) and has successfully acquired France’s first licensed stablecoin issuer, Salvus SAS, securing its Electronic Money Institution (EMI) and Electronic Money Token (EMT) regulatory licence. With this licence, has launched EURØP which will be immediately listed on leading centralised exchanges and DeFi protocols. Initially available on Ethereum and Polygon, EURØP will expand to additional chains in the upcoming months. The company’s fiat reserves will be securely custodied with Société Générale, one of Europe’s top banks, a partnership that not only ensures the safety of reserves, but also provides Schuman access to deep banking expertise, and likely, seamless integration between traditional finance and DeFi. Viktor Fischer, Founder & CEO of RockawayX , states, “We see major tailwinds for the adoption of EUR-denominated stablecoins, including regulatory clarity, non-zero EUR interest rates, demand by non-US digital asset traders for alternative FX exposure—and all against a backdrop of the DeFi market’s expansion as new assets and capital come on-chain. Schuman’s specialised focus on the European market, enviable regulatory position, and the team’s expertise across traditional and digital asset markets give us high conviction that this one’s a winner.” RockawayX led the company's €7 million seed funding round supoered by further investors such as Lightspeed Faction , Kraken Ventures , Nexo Ventures , Gnosis VC , Delta Blockchain Fund , Bankless Ventures , and several angel investors.

The funds will into further studies and advancements as the company drives towards its mission of treating genetic disorders without gene therapies. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare genetic disorder of the nervous system stemming from a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A (ARSA); it is most common in toddlers aged 12 to 20 months (late infantile MLD). Tragically, this condition is usually diagnosed after symptoms appear, making it too late to treat with available therapies and resulting in most children being unable to survive past the age of five. Based in Geneva and launched in 2023, Release Therapeutics is at the forefront of developing the first cell macroencapsulation technology designed to deliver potent therapeutic proteins beyond the human blood-brain barrier. Its proprietary technology integrates an implantable macroencapsulation device with an immortalised myoblast cell line capable of producing a broad range of proteins for long-term delivery to the CNS. The company recently formed a strategic collaboration with the Innovation Unit for Gene and Cell Therapy (GENOV) at the Paris Brain Institute to assess the impact of the Company’s technology on mice presenting symptoms of MLD. The mice were implanted with an analogue of Release’s Myo-P device and received ARSA enzyme replacement therapy over three months. After three months of treatment, the mice showed a reversal of disease progression, suggesting the Company’s technology holds great promise in treating symptomatic MLD. The results were presented by Dr Françoise Piguet, Head of GENOV, Paris Brain Institute, at the 20th WORLD Symposium for Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) in February 2024, with the abstract published in a recent special issue of Molecular Genetics and Metabolism . The closing of its seed round with private investors allows the company to progress its clinical development programs. Thomas Mehrling, CEO of Release said, ""The Seed funding testifies to the significance of our collaboration with the Paris Brain Institute and our findings towards treating MLD. The proceeds will be invested immediately in assessing the impact of our technology in non-human primates. With the results expected in autumn 2024, we plan to launch a Series A raise in the final quarter of this year to submit an IND application and get our technology into the clinic as soon as possible."""

The Swiss CDR specialist has developed and deployed an IP-protected solution that allows the durable removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by capturing CO2 at point source, then binding it in mineral waste streams via an accelerated mineralization process. Neustark , a Switzerland-based carbon removal provider, has raised $69 million in a funding round to underpin its rapid scale-up in the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) market. The growth equity round was led by Decarbonization Partners , a partnership between BlackRock and Temasek, and will reinforce neustark’s continued growth path and support their mission to permanently remove 1 million tons of CO 2 in the year 2030 . Climate tech growth investor Blume Equity also participated in the round. The new investors join neustark’s existing backers, which are all continuing their support: Holcim , Siemens Financial Services , Verve Ventures , and ACE Ventures . In addition, UBS has contributed capital to the round via debt financing. Neustark also has a strategic collaboration with Holcim to scale up its carbon removal technology globally, enabling building solutions that are both circular and low-carbon. Neustark co-founder Johannes Tiefenthaler and Ueli Bötschi, Head of New Business Development at Holcim, shared insights about this partnership at a recent SEF.Growth event. From capturing CO2 at biogas plants to permanent storage Biogenic CO 2 is captured from partnering biogas plants, then liquified and transported to construction waste recycling sites. There, the carbon dioxide is injected into concrete granulates from demolished buildings or other mineral waste such as slag and slurry. Neustark’s technology triggers an accelerated mineralization process, binding the CO 2 permanently to the pores and surface of the granules. The carbonated, recycled aggregate can then be used to build roads or to produce fresh recycled building materials. The mineralization process stores the captured CO 2 for hundreds of thousands of years, and the risk of reversal is proven to be slim to none. “We turn the world’s largest waste stream – demolition concrete – into a carbon sink. In the last year, we have already deployed our unique solution at 19 sites. This growth investment will take us into the next exciting phase of our mission, helping us to further scale our impact across Europe, enter new markets in North America and Asia Pacific, and develop new solutions to store even more CO 2 in mineral waste streams,” said Johannes Tiefenthaler, co-CEO and founder at neustark. Neustark has sold nearly 120,000 tons of carbon removal to date, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing carbon removal companies, with clients including Microsoft, UBS and NextGen. All projects are certified under the Gold Standard to ensure credible third-party assessment and transparency related to performance. Scaling up across the world Neustark will be able to capitalize on Decarbonization Partners’ global platform and reach, including its access to corporates and investors across North America and Asia Pacific and its dedicated decarbonization specialists as well as Blume Equity's deep climate network and expertise in scaling European disruptive climate tech companies. With their partnership, alongside neustark’s existing investors – all of whom possess extensive technology investment portfolios –, neustark will expand its team and enhance its offerings to meet the increasing global demand for CDR. Meghan Sharp, Global Head & Chief Investment Officer of Decarbonization Partners, said: “With carbon capture, utilization and storage being one of our key investment focuses, we believe that we have found a perfect partner to help scale the industry – and ultimately its decarbonization impact – in the years to come. With their unique business model that seamlessly integrates two existing and mature industries without disrupting their day-to-day operations, neustark has established themselves as one of the global leaders in high-quality durable CDR with a solution that is removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere today.” (Press release / SK) Photo: Neustark Founder and Co-CEOs Valentin Gutknecht (l.) and Johannes Tiefenthaler"

Expanding beyond AWS will strengthen LocalStack’s role as the de-facto platform for local cloud development and will enable new use cases like developing cross-cloud integrations, or testing cloud migrations where workloads get moved from one platform to another. The team is also doubling down on advanced features around developer experience (DevX), team collaboration, and deep application insights. A big focus of its work is to enable use cases that are hard or impossible to achieve in the real cloud - for example, snapshotting and restoring the full state of a cloud app, or inspecting the messages of an event-based application and re-playing individual events for debugging, or simulating an outage of an entire cloud region to test application resilience. The team envisions a world where developers can test application functionality, security, and resilience, play with chaos engineering, and prepare for every scenario—all within LocalStack. (ES)"

The funds will fuel the development of its biochar reactor technology and robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system in Colombia. With the agricultural sector under pressure, Cotierra (formerly Terra Preta) sees immense potential for biochar to transform the industry by boosting the impact of regenerative agriculture practices and restoring essential carbon to the soil. According to the IPCC (2019), agriculture, forestry, and other land-use sectors account for 23% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, soil degradation is happening rapidly, especially in the Global South, with most land used for agriculture experiencing a significant loss of soil carbon. Cotierra has developed a biochar solution tailored to the unique conditions of the Global South, starting with coffee. By converting coffee tree residues into biochar and applying it back to the plantations, Cotierra locks away carbon in the soil for centuries, restores soil health, and boosts farm productivity. This unique decentralized approach, enabled by its cost-effective and mobile reactor combined with a tamper-proofed Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification MRV system, allows the production of biochar near or on the farm. This makes it ideal for serving extensive smallholder farm networks that characterize coffee supply chains while effectively reducing logistic costs and avoiding increased biomass competition for centralized residues. The secured funding will enable the company to fast-track the development and prove the operational feasibility of its innovative and cost-effective biochar reactor technology and robust MRV system in Colombia. The funds will also support agronomy studies to validate further emission reduction benefits and farmers' margins increase, to help our clients accelerate the regenerative agriculture transformation and generate reliable data for their sustainability claims.

The funds will enable the startup to accelerate its AI Job Simulation technology, expand its catalogue of Skill Paths and AI Simulations with thousands of them to let customers start in hours, and team growth in the EMEA and US region. Anthropos was founded by Stefano Bellasio and Giacomo Marinangeli after building Cloud Academy Inc, a cloud training platform they started in 2013. The duo scaled the business to over $25M in ARR with Fortune 500 customers like Microsoft, Warner Media, and Deloitte, and, in the process, realized the majority of their enterprise customers were struggling with the same interrelated problems: employee retention and skills development. After exiting the business to the UK's largest tech training provider, Stefano and Giacomo founded Anthropos to help corporates. Anthropos provides companies with a platform to centralize all their skills, employee experiences and training libraries. On the one hand, companies can map out dedicated paths for every role inside the organization and on the other hand employees can upskill themselves in accordance with the roles they want to advance in. Additionally, companies can constantly assess what skills are relevant for each role and verify which employees have those skills. This is a significant improvement from the status quo of long, convoluted employee questionnaires to ascertain skill abilities. Central to evidencing its approach, Anthropos can verify soft and technical skills at different stages of the employee lifecycle, from hiring to training and progression. As part of the platform, Anthropos has built its own skills' taxonomy, which currently covers over 60,000 skills and 18,000 job roles. Additionally, it has developed ‘AI Job Simulations’ which helps to screen candidates at scale by placing them into immersive real-life scenarios with virtual customers, stakeholders, and colleagues where they can solve missions that demonstrate their soft and hard skills.

The proceeds from the round will fuel the company’s commercialization and expand the manufacturing capacity of its unique RNA sequencing products. In line with the round, the startup announced the establishment of its US subsidiary. Based in Lausanne, Alithea Genomics is an emerging company  in the field of large-scale RNA sequencing and transcriptomics. The company commercializes massively multiplexed library preparation solutions for RNA sequencing, with two products in the market, notably the BRB-seq and DRUG-seq, which enable the preparation of hundreds of RNA samples for sequencing in a single tube and without the need for RNA isolation, respectively. Traditional preparation of samples for RNA sequencing is expensive and time-consuming, due to the large amounts of reagents and manual operations that are typically required. Alithea’s BRB-seq technology enables researchers to discover novel biomarkers and essential data needed to develop new drugs while drastically decreasing the cost and time associated with RNA sequencing preparation. Following the initial seed financing, Alithea Genomics has made significant progress – the company grew its product portfolio with the addition of DRUG-seq that is now used by several big pharma companies to improve drug development processes and expanded its overall production and service capacity. Tens of thousands of RNA samples can now be processed quickly and with high quality. “Since our initial seed investment, the Alithea team has delivered on all its milestones and exceeded our expectations in the progress being made,” said Jan Van den Berghe, co-founder and managing director of Novalis Biotech. “In two short years, we have seen the market for Alithea’s ultra-high throughput RNA sequencing products expand and grow into multiple areas.” Alongside Novalis Biotech Acceleration Novalis Biotech, the seed extension round saw the participation of new investor TechU Ventures and existing investors. The secured CHF 2.8 million will enable the company to boost commercialization, expand the manufacturing capacity of its RNA sequencing products, advance the development of new technologies.

The funds will be used to demonstrate endoscopic delivery of TissueSpan implants. Regenosca developed and patented TissueSpan, a technology which allows for the creation of off-the-shelf and ready-to-use regenerative implants that serve as a noninvasive alternative to patients’ tissue grafts. The current gold-standard procedure involves open surgery and the harvesting of a patient's own inner mouth tissue for grafting, and simpler endoscopic treatments have up to 80% failure rates. Regenosca’s tissues are designed to prevent a second surgical site for tissue harvesting, reducing pain, complications, and surgery time for patients. The first indication is Urethral reconstruction, which is required to address a narrowed urinary passage, a so-called urethral stricture, which affects up to a million patients a year in the U.S. Results from its first-in-man study for urethral strictures confirmed the effectiveness of tissue healing at the implantation site, with perfect regrowth of the patients’ own tissue. Regenosca has successfully raised CHF 1 million from private investors, Business Angels Switzerland , and Venture Kick . “This funding will allow us to demonstrate endoscopic delivery of TissueSpan”, said Eva-Maria Balet, CEO and co-founder. “This new approach will revolutionize the treatment of urethral stricture. An off-the-shelf implant instead of the patient’s own tissue. A simple endoscopic procedure instead of complex open surgery.” Besides the positive clinical developments, Regenosca has gained market traction and received support from organizations like Venture Kick and the Gebert Rüf Foundation, as well as won awards at the three biggest urology conferences globally: the European Association of Urology, the Société Internationale d’Urologie, and the American Urological Association.

With first partners already using the solution, the startup continues to secure funding to accelerate the time to market. The latest funding round involved S2S Ventures and the Zürcher Kantonbank. New pharmaceutical drugs are increasingly complex in molecular structure, and there are no measurement tools able to measure the important aspects of new, more complex molecules. Because measuring molecular structure is an essential aspect in drug discovery, development and manufacturing, the current technological gap is preventing new and even more promising pharmaceutical drugs from moving through the discovery and development pipeline and increasing costs for manufacturing existing drugs. During the past five years at the ETH, ENANTIOS has developed a measurement device capable of fully characterizing complex molecules, including chiral molecules and biologics. The technology enables complete, nondestructive characterization of a wide range of molecules much more quickly and cheaply than other available techniques and can resolve structures that are impossible to measure with existing tools. Enantios can resolve key aspects of complex molecular structures related to chirality that other technologies cannot see. The startup team provides its technology as a measurement instrument and measurement service to enable faster screening of molecular structure early in the drug development process and more complete testing of quality in manufacturing. Established in December 2022, ENANTIOS has a functional prototype of its patent-pending measurement instrument that is already operational. Carin Lightner, the CEO and co-founder, stated, “We are currently utilizing our prototype for measuring publicly available pharmaceutical molecules and collaborating with pharma and chemical manufacturing customers for proof-of-concept studies.” The commercial version, expected to launch in Q4 2024, will initially target the pharmaceutical development sector. At the end of last year, Enantios received fresh funding from the student VC S2S Ventures as part of a bridge funding round, which saw the participation of the Zürcher Kantonalbank. The round raised CHF 225k of convertible loan. The funding complements previous support from that Venture Kick Stage 2 and 200K in non-dilutive funding from the ESA Bic Switzerland and CHF 130K from Bridge Proof of Concept. In total, the startup has secured CHF 300k equity. A larger financing round is planned to accelerate the time to market and expand the team. Today, Enantios employs four people with an advisory board of four. “We are finalizing contracts for our measurement-as-a-service product and securing sales for our first measurement instruments in academic research labs,” added Carina.

The capital will be utilized in establishing the company’s European presence. Based in Manno, Hive Power is a pioneering provider of advanced smart grid solutions aimed at enhancing the integration of renewable energy and electric vehicles into intelligent power networks. Within a few years, Hive Power has formed strong partnerships with leading hardware and software providers in the energy and mobility sectors, such as Sorgenia, Free2Move eSolutions, and Haier. Founded by Gianluca Corbellini and Davide Rivola, the company has gained traction and significant market validation with projects in Switzerland, as well as Austria, Italy, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. Following the recent  €3.5 million seed investment from Axpo and Creadd Ventures as well as the Technology Fund , Hive Power is well-positioned to fuel its European expansion as it scales up FLEXO, the company’s AI-based software for optimising electric vehicle (EV) charging. According to Corbellin co-founder and CEO of Hive Power, 2025 will be the year of FLEXO. “Our flexibility optimization tool times EV charging to align with renewable energy availability—what we call ‘solar charging’—and the lowest day-ahead prices. While many companies offer basic smart charging, FLEXO goes further by adding ancillary services to balance the grid. This can help EV owners earn up to €1,000 annually on passenger vehicles and up to €13,000 on heavy-duty vehicles.” Ford CEO Jim Farley recently highlighted that the real key to widespread EV adoption is creating a model that costs less than $30,000 (€28,000). FLEXO is contributing to this goal by reducing the total cost of EV ownership through intelligent grid interactions and incentives, rather than by lowering production costs alone. In just one example of its deep tech capabilities, Hive Power is collaborating with Axpo and Clyde Mobility, a popular Swiss car subscription service which is part of AMAG Group. In this case, FLEXO aggregates the capacity of over 1,000 EVs in Switzerland, providing grid support services to the national transmission operator. Many grid operators face the surprising need to dial back green generation due to grid saturation. FLEXO addresses this by using EVs as ‘energy absorbers’ when renewables surge, ensuring that excess green power isn’t wasted. This innovative approach helps keep renewable generation online and supports the energy transition without interruption. Conversely, during peak demand, charging pauses, minimizing the risk of blackouts. “We’re excited to see our investment in Hive Power bring new capabilities to grids, allowing them to integrate more renewables, expedite the energy transition, and reduce EV costs for users,” commented Georg Schumacher, Senior Manager, Partnering and Investing at Axpo. “What’s more, as an international player across Europe and the US, we’re excited to see this innovation proliferate to other countries where we’re active.” (RAN)"

The company is enhancing its ecosystem with the stablecoin USDN, a fully decentralized synthetic dollar token backed by a fully decentralized ETH perpetual contract that - for the first time in crypto - delivers a delta-neutral strategy. A delta-neutral strategy is an investment strategy in which the overall delta of a portfolio is zero, meaning that the portfolio is not exposed to changes in the price of the underlying asset. Addressing the vulnerabilities exposed by previous algorithmic stablecoins like Terra Luna, USDN will synthesize the stability of the US dollar using a tried and tested traditional finance strategy that carries no risk of external counterparty liquidation. USDN utilizes ETH, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, to create a novel structured product. The core innovation lies in a mathematically precise Delta Neutral strategy that ensures those shorting ETH by minting USDN are always equally balanced by those going long ETH within the SMARDEX platform. This is controlled by a smart contract that ensures positions are always equally weighted, preventing the systemic risks that plagued previous stablecoin models, ensuring there can never be a run on either asset. For example, if ETH's price doubles, a long position earns 100% (double the value). Simultaneously, a short position loses 50%. The net result is no profit or loss in USD terms, because the gains and losses cancel each other out, creating a synthetic stable USD value. Ultimately, this means that USDN will always remain linked to the value of USD $1. Demonstrating remarkable market validation, RA2 TECH has invested $12M into SMARDEX’s development. In November, the protocol governance opened a public seed round for USDN through a sub-token: sUSDN. The market response was positive – less than 45 minutes after the announcement, over $1 million of total value locked (TVL) was seeded. Rapid adoption continued, with $3m seeded within 24 hours. The company has now raised $4.5 million in the total value locked (TVL) imediately after the launch. Since September, thousands of daily users have been testing USDN through SMARDEX’s testnet. Moving forward, USDN can be staked for a substantial yield through the website . This initial liquidity will serve critical strategic purposes, including launching the protocol, scheduled for release in January 2025. ""Backing a coin designed to be stable in value with an asset that can fall to zero - as Terra Luna did - is a recipe for disaster. In our case, the protocol position is Delta Neutral, which means that, for the first time – and without having to rely on centralized liquidity – you can have a token that's worth around $1, pays you interest, and is intrinsically resilient, powered by the SMARDEX ecosystem.""

The company has secured $25 million in an ongoing series A funding round to develop and test the device, aiming for a pre-launch in early 2026. Founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur Leo Grünstein, Liom , with offices in Pfäffikon SZ and San Francisco has raised over USD 55m in equity funding to-date and employs a team of >80 FTE. The company has kicked-off a USD 50-70m Series A, of which USD >25m have already been secured. This will allow Liom to develop and test its wrist-worn prototype on 100+ people by end of 2025 and launch a pre-launch sales campaign of its wearable in H1 2026, the world's first non-invasive glucose monitoring device that offers accurate glucose measurements without the need for invasive per-subject calibration using a needle, putting it ahead of established players in the wearable business, such as Apple, Samsung and Google. Multiple internal and external studies conducted throughout 2024 with >60 subjects have demonstrated the device’s capability. In a recent third-party validation study, Liom's proprietary benchtop system and AI algorithms demonstrated a MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference) of 14.5% without any per-subject calibration (publication pre-print available here ). MARD is the percentage error to the reference measurement, which in this case is a catheter-derived venous measurement. The light-& AI-only measurements show excellent agreement with reference blood glucose values for a wide range of glucose levels and time series. Using per-subject calibration, the MARD attained was even lower, at 7%. This performance is comparable to the first generation of needle-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, which, after 10 years of optimization, have gradually reached the 10% MARD level. Currently, these devices, predominantly sold by the two medtech giants Abbott and Dexcom, dominate the strongly growing CGM market of USD >10bn that is attempting expansion towards healthy consumers, despite requiring replacement of its needle-based technology every 10–14 days. Liom sees significant potential for further improvement of its performance in the near term, enabled by its purely light- and AI-driven approach that allows for rapid iteration. Leveraging the company’s proprietary light- and AI-based technology, the device provides additional health metrics, such as heart rate and movement, enabling consumers looking to optimize an active, healthy lifestyle, improve their habits, or mitigate the risk of developing health conditions. Further biomarkers, including macronutrients like lipids and proteins, as well as ketones, hydration, and lactate, will be added to the device, paving the way for even broader applications.

This investment, which includes a substantial CHF 750,000 contribution from the Wyss Center in Geneva, will propel dEEGtal’s cutting-edge solution towards clinical validation and market readiness. A Critical Need for Better Diagnosis Tools for 10 Million Patients Annually Each year, about 10 million people worldwide experience a possible first epileptic seizure, yet up to 80% of initial EEG readings appear normal, delaying accurate diagnoses and worsening patients’ prognosis. Current diagnostic approaches are highly specific but lack sensitivity, contributing to an alarming 70% risk of relapse in untreated patients and serious impact on quality of life, with potential restrictions on their ability to work or drive. “Our mission at dEEGtal is to bridge this gap by using AI to detect subtle, often-overlooked markers of epilepsy,” says Eric Ménétré, CEO and co-founder of dEEGtal.  Margitta Seeck, head of the EEG and Epilepsy Unit at Geneva University Hospital (HUG), co-founder of dEEGtal, adds: “This cutting-edge approach not only enhances diagnostic precision but also offers a transformative tool for clinicians, enabling earlier interventions and ultimately improving patients' quality of life.” A Unique AI-Driven Approach What sets dEEGtal apart is its use of artificial intelligence models trained on large EEG datasets. The software generates a comprehensive risk score even when standard visual indicators of epilepsy are absent, giving doctors vital insights that were previously unattainable. Additionally, dEEGtal offers a user-friendly interface, automated medical reporting, and seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. The CHF 1 million seed round, with CHF 750,000 contributed by the Wyss Center, will be used to refine the AI models, conduct clinical validation studies, and guide dEEGtal to regulation. “We are thrilled to have the Wyss Center’s support. Their expertise in MedTech innovation and regulatory pathways is invaluable as we advance our technology”, Eric Ménétré added. Accelerating Development and Market Entry The funding will fast-track dEEGtal’s plans to obtain FDA clearance for the American market, followed by efforts to secure CE marking in Europe and Switzerland. “Our strategy includes introducing our solution in leading neurology centers in the USA and expanding internationally,” explains Stefano Gallotto, CTO and co-founder. Targeting a Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity The global epilepsy diagnostics market is expected to grow from CHF 3.3 billion in 2024 to more than CHF 10 billion by 2032. dEEGtal is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of this market by offering an innovative solution which not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also serves as a tool for ruling out other conditions like syncope and stroke. “Epilepsy is just our starting point, but our vision extends way beyond, already foreseeing this technology applied to different neurological diseases” says Stefano Gallotto.

CYBERA is now using AI to automate the detection of accounts, thus complementing the startup's existing offering. The current strong growth is being fuelled additionally by a new round of financing. CYBERA , the specialized company founded by former cybercrime prosecutor Nicola Staub, recognized three years ago, upon its founding, that an effective approach to combating scams and cyber fraud involves reporting fraudulent bank accounts to banks as early as possible. This information-sharing is particularly effective because fraudsters often reuse the same account multiple times. For the past two years, CYBERA has successfully assisted victims in reporting these accounts and forwarding them to partner banks. Using AI to automate ""ethical scambaiting"" Ethical scambaiting is an innovative method for early identification of fraudulent accounts. By using AI technology and automating ethical scambaiting, CYBERA has developed an advanced system that uncovers thousands of fraudulent accounts each month. This method combines ethical practices with cutting-edge technology to gather crucial information from fraudsters, such as bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. The system deceives criminal scammers by simulating potential victims, prompting them to reveal their bank accounts for supposed payments. These accounts are then promptly reported to CYBERA and partner banks, which immediately block them, preventing fraudulent payments. Impressive Results The results are impressive: fraudsters can be stopped before they cause harm. The identified accounts are added to a regularly updated database. Banks working with CYBERA use this data to detect and block suspicious transactions, providing effective protection for their customers and enhancing trust in digital payments. This is increasingly important with the recent introduction of real-time payments in Switzerland, where quick fraud detection is critical. In general, CYBERA is currently growing strongly. ""Compared to the previous year, i.e. 2023, revenue growth as of mid-September is currently around 211% and continues to rise,"" says CYBERA founder Nicola Staub. In addition to customers, investors are also backing the start-up. CYBERA was able to close another financing round in the summer of 2024. All existing investors participated and were joined by new institutional and private investors from the US. The funds from the financing round will be used to further expand technology and products – including ethical scambating. In addition, the money will be used to drive growth in Switzerland and Central Europe and to accelerate market entry in the US. (Press release / SK) Picture: RoraHero / Pixabay"
S3920,n.a.,,,,https://www.startupticker.ch/en/news/primal-bee-closes-its-first-seed-round-and-ships-the-first-commercial-batch,0.0,0.0,2024-10-18,VC,Seed,TI,BeeHelpful SA (Primal Bee),Male,"Ticino-based startup Primal Bee secures seed funding and ships its first commercial batch of over 300 innovative hives, designed to reduce colony losses, increase honey production, and lower maintenance costs. With plans to expand on a global stage, the company aims to set new standards in beekeeping through a bee-centric hive design. As bee populations continue to decline, ecosystems and food security are at risk, highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions. Bees play an essential role in pollinating crops and maintaining biodiversity, yet current beekeeping methods are proving inadequate in protecting them. Against this background, Ticino-based startup Primal Bee offers a solution that could make a substantial difference, benefiting both beekeepers and the environment. Co-founded by Alex Gamberoni, Gianmario Riganti and Tomer Moldovan, the startup has developed a new standard hive that reduces colony losses, increases honey production and cuts maintenance costs. The company recently celebrated the successful closure of its first seed funding round and shipped its first commercial batch of innovative beehives. The solution: a beehive designed with bees in mind The inspiration behind Primal Bee came from Gianmario and Alex’s experience as amateur beekeepers. ""For three years, we lost all our bees,"" says Alex. ""We soon realized the traditional hive, unchanged for over 150 years, wasn’t designed with the bees in mind, but for human convenience, particularly for transportation."" After years of research and prototyping, the Primal Bee new standard hive was born, a product tailored to the needs of the bees themselves, resulting in healthier and more productive colonies. Extensive field testing in over 20 locations across Europe and the U.S. has demonstrated the effectiveness of Primal Bee’s design, reducing colony losses to just 10% while doubling bee populations and honey production. The hive’s enhanced thermodynamic efficiency and insulation are key factors in its success, reducing human intervention and maintenance costs by up to 70%. “By improving thermal efficiency and airflow, we’ve allowed bees to do what they do best: grow and produce honey. In this way, beekeepers can focus on scaling their operations,” explains Alex. First seed round and shipment of a 300-unit commercial batch The recent shipment of Primal Bee’s first commercial batch marks a major achievement for the startup. Produced in partnership with Italian manufacturer Bazzica Srl , known for their expertise in expanded polystyrene (EPS), the initial batch of 352 hives has been distributed to Israel, Switzerland, Germany, France, and the United States. Made from 100% recyclable EPS, the hives are eco-friendly, durable, and highly efficient. This shipment is just the beginning of Primal Bee’s global expansion, as the company has its sights set on entering new markets where beekeeping innovations are in high demand, including Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. The recent seed round, which exceeded initial expectations, provides the financial backing needed for this expansion. Although the specific funding amount remains undisclosed, the investment will support increased production and pilot projects in Israel and the U.S. A new paradigm in beekeeping With patents secured in key regions, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia, applications pending in other countries, and other patents in preparation for further improvements on specific features and to enhance IP protection, Primal Bee plans to initiate additional pilot projects in Israel. These projects will further validate the hive’s innovative design and performance under diverse conditions. ""We’ve achieved significant breakthroughs with bees that have yet to be documented in scientific literature,” Alex notes. “Our goal is to publish our findings, contributing to the scientific community and demonstrating the validity of our approach."" Looking ahead, Primal Bee is preparing for its next equity funding round, expected in 2025. The goal is to replace the outdated traditional beehives with a modern, efficient, and bee-centric design on a global scale. “The beehive design hasn’t changed since the 19th century,” says Alex. “Our ambition is to become the new global standard in beekeeping, adding More Bees on The Trees .” (Luca Calderara)"

The ETH Zurich spin-off closed a $3.8 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful and HCVC. Research has evidenced the use case and impact of nanomaterials across a range of electronics including high-performance transistors, low-power sensors, quantum devices, and many more. However, existing production methods, mostly based on chemistry, are not controllable, which has thus far prevented commercialization of these devices. Chiral has built high-speed, automated, robotic machines that integrate nanomaterials into devices. These machines can robotically place micrometer-sized (or even nanometer-sized) materials on small chips. Repeating these motions in a fast and automated manner requires a very high level of engineering, which, when done right, ensures the precision and control that conventional chemistry-based methods lack. The development of Chiral’s technology started as a national research project conducted at the ETH Domain institutions (ETH Zurich, EPFL, and Empa), in which the company’s co-founders, Seoho Jung, Natanael Lanz, and Andre Butzerin participated as PhD students. After 4 years of R&D, the research team finished its first prototype machine, which was 100 times faster than the other systems available at the time. The immediate reaction of the market to the prototype, which quickly led to the company’s first batch of pilot customers, convinced the co-founders that they should continue their activity as a company. They incorporated Chiral in June 2023 as a result. The pre-seed funding round will accelerate the development of Chiral’s next machine, which will unlock new market opportunities with its versatility and performance. In addition, the startup will scale its team to keep up with the growing demand and customer base. The round was co-led by Founderful (formerly Wingman Ventures) and HCVC and includes grants from ETH Zurich and Venture Kick . Enabling the AI revolution Alexis Houssou, Founding Partner at HCVC, commented: “With the current boom in AI applications, we stand at a pivotal moment where the slowdown of Moore's law threatens to decelerate the pace of technological progress significantly. The team at Chiral has embarked on a critical mission to pave the way toward a groundbreaking post-silicon era, promising to transcend current limitations and unlock new possibilities for advancement. We couldn't be more excited to support their mission, in collaboration with Founderful, as they build the future of computing infrastructure.” Pascal Mathis, Founding Partner at Founderful, commented: “We're thrilled to join forces with Chiral alongside HCVC. Chiral's AI- and robotics-based technology lets us envision a future where nanomaterial-based chips are being produced at the scale needed for commercialization – a major bottleneck up until now. We look forward to supporting Seoho, Natanael and André in their journey to introduce a new paradigm of chips beyond silicon.” Seoho Jung added: “In the future, it will be normal for electronic devices or chips to contain nanomaterials. The development roadmaps of the world's leading chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all share our vision. We are confident that Chiral technology will empower the industry to make this transition faster.""

When developing new drugs, nutritional products, or pesticides, it i s critical that unknown molecules are identified correctly. But accurate identification is a lengthy process and all too often unsuccessful, leading to failed regulatory processes, or worse, consumer health being put in danger. Based on over 20 years of research, Isospec Analytic s founders Ahmed Ben Faleh, Stephan Warnke, and Thomas Rizzo combined technol ogies from multiple disciplines – analytical chemistry, photonics, and cryogenic materials initially designed for space applications – to build a tool that can generate a new data dimension about molecular structures in minutes . The company ’s technology generates unique , information-rich metrics that allow for the rapid identification of unknown molecules in minutes instead of months , bringing unprecedented scalability to molecular identification . The technology is already being used in the analysis of sugars and metabolites within the food and agritech industry to carry out quality control and support product R&D. However , the team believes the real potential of their technology is in the discovery of new biomarkers for therapeutics development and diagnostics . “In a human blood sample, there are 15,000 small biological molecules that can give precise information about a person’s health at any given time.

These combined use cases were compelling for Isospec’s investors. “Isospec’s value proposition, which offers early access to its cutting-edge research in biomolecular analysis as a service, convinced us of the potential of the technology and the team,” explains Alex Stöckl, partner at Founderful and board member of Isospec. “Isospec is one of the first 8 companies in which we have invested with our second fund, which aims to reach $120M.” Following the launch of its platform, Isospec Analytics has raised $1.9M in its pre-seed funding round led by Founderful (formerly Wingman Ventures), with additional participation from specialized investors Tiny.vc , another.vc and Venture Kick . The funds will s u p port the company through the commercial phase. The team is currently working on the scalability of their platform, introducing automation at every step and implementing machine learning tools for data analysis and insight generation. “ This round allows us to build a software team composed of experts in data engineering,” said Dr Ahmed Ben Faleh. Against the highly competitive backdrop of the sugar and metabolite analytical markets, Isospec is setting its sights on becoming the leading provider of molecular analysis solutions and biomarker discovery technology.

Founded by Gianluca De Novi, who acts as CEO, Lugano-based Circular Global Ledgers SA has developed Circular Protocol a fourth-generation blockchain platform designed to reshape how businesses interact with decentralized systems.  At the heart of its offering is its unique approach to scalability, security and decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that often struggle with increased transaction volumes, Circular Protocol's architecture allows for seamless expansion. By implementing a sharding mechanism, the platform can grow its capacity in tandem with user demand, ensuring consistent performance even as adoption increases. A key feature of the protocol is flexibility, whereby companies can create their own private blockchain or build applications on the public Circular Protocol network. This dual approach caters to businesses with varying privacy and control requirements, from those needing complete data sovereignty to others seeking the benefits of a public blockchain ecosystem. Security and accessibility are paramount, and the platform guarantees fast, immutable transactions, providing businesses with a reliable foundation for their blockchain-based operations. Circular is compliant with regulations, like GDPR and HIPAA. Following the go-live in Q2 this year, the startup targets players in healthcare, aiming to pioneer data auditing technologies for sensitive areas like medical records and clinical trials, as well as DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and GameFi (a fusion of online gaming and decentralized finance) companies which can use the platform to protect their data, perform digital twinning and smart contract to execute their operations securely. Currently, Circular has grown its community to over 100,000 people who purchased the CIRX token, a native coin on the Circular platform, to pay for transactions and rewards. CIRX is currently being traded on Coinmarketcap . Additionally, the startup has secured partnerships with enterprises in healthcare and industrial to work on some use cases. “We have major partnerships’ announcements coming, with tier-one names lining up to leverage our infrastructure for their daily business, from world-known consultancies to large corporations, plus private equity ecosystems, active in both AI and blockchain.

The Zurich-based company closed a Series A funding round led by Swisscom Ventures. One in five workdays is lost to poor mental health, yet companies continue pouring billions into wellness programs that fail to move the needle. Today, Kyan Health announces $16.7M in funding to transform this broken model, combining AI-powered preventive care with organizational insights that help companies treat employee wellbeing as a strategic, measurable investment rather than a box-ticking exercise. The funding comprises a previously unannounced $4M seed round led by Amplo VC and a $12.7M Series A led by Swisscom Ventures , with participation from GreyMatter Capital , naturalX Health Ventures , Founderful , Joyance Partners and several angel investors. This brings Kyan's total funding to $18.4M as it expands its platform globally. Kyan Health was co-founded by Vlad Gheorghiu, Konstantin Struck, and Ignacio Leonhardt. Vlad, a former leader of McKinsey's global mental health program, experienced firsthand the challenges of managing mental health in high-pressure environments. Together with Konstantin, a former Associate Partner at McKinsey & Company, and Ignacio, a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Handy.com, they launched Kyan Health with a mission to provide both individualized care and systemic solutions that address organizational needs. While companies globally spend over $94 billion annually on workplace wellbeing initiatives, most programs remain stuck in a reactive model of crisis management. ""Mental health isn't a fluffy perk—it's the backbone of a thriving workforce,"" said Vlad Gheorghiu, CEO and Co-Founder of Kyan Health. ""When I struggled personally, and later when I led a global mental health program, I saw firsthand how inadequate the tools were to address real challenges. This investment is about changing that—creating the tools I wish had existed, making mental health measurable, and giving organizations the power to act before crises hit."" AI-powered enterprise solution Kyan Health provides its services through a subscription-based model for enterprise clients. At the heart of Kyan's platform is Kai, an AI-powered care navigator that connects employees to personalized resources—from crisis support to certified coaching and mental health counseling. The platform operates as a ""trusted third party,"" offering users confidential access to tools with end-to-end encryption. No personal data is shared with employers; only aggregated insights are used to enhance workplace conditions while safeguarding privacy. The impact is already evident among Kyan's enterprise clients. Notable clients like Hitachi Energy, Hilti, STADA, Deutsche Börse Group, and On have already seen tangible results. At On, the Swiss performance sportswear company, Kyan's platform achieved a 50% employee engagement rate and delivered $2.9M in annual value through improved productivity, reduced attrition, and cost savings—representing an 11.6x ROI. ""We decided to work with Kyan, as they are the only provider that truly supports the organizational and individual angle at the same time with an end-to-end solution,"" said Achim Braun, CHRO of Hitachi Energy, responsible for 40,000 employees globally. ""We've been working with Kyan since 2022 and we are excited to continue our partnership!"" ""Kyan Health is transforming how businesses support mental health and well-being by providing predictive, scalable solutions that address the needs of global enterprises. We're excited to back a company that's at the forefront of this shift,"" said Victoria Lietha, Investment Director at Swisscom Ventures, who led the investment and is joining the Kyan Health Board of Directors. While companies routinely apply predictive maintenance to physical assets, they've overlooked their most valuable resource: their people. Kyan Health is changing this paradigm, helping organizations address absenteeism and productivity challenges before they impact the bottom line. This shift from reactive support to strategic investment marks a new era in corporate mental health, where wellbeing becomes a measurable driver of business performance.

DAAV was established as an EPFL spinoff with the mission to improve the quality of life for people with reduced mobility (PRM). Its flagship product DAAV-air is an innovative wheelchair designed to make airports accessible for PRM to reduce operational costs for service providers. The device features an innovative omnidirectional motion mechanism, granting passengers an unparalleled degree of mobility. This technology significantly improves airport accessibility by navigating in all directions, facilitating seamless movement throughout airport layouts. Moreover, DAAV-air operates in various smart modes, from tele-operation to follow-me or fully autonomous, ensuring flexibility and convenience for users. With DAAV-air, airports can provide additional mobility services to clients around the clock without the need for additional staff. The proceeds from its funding round will allow DAAV to fast-track product development, expand pilot implementations globally, and drive market entry initiatives. “Many airports have reached out to us for pilots, from Zurich to Vienna, to Changi in Singapore”, says Mohsen Falahi, CEO of DAAV. Building on its early traction from early pilots, DAAV and its team of six employees is poised to scale its operations and address the growing demand for innovative mobility solutions in the aviation industry. Lead investor, Spicehaus Partners AG , was joined by kickfund , TR-Invest Thomas Rauber , and Dieter R. Streuli , CEO of Airline Assistance Switzerland (AAS) in the round. “This milestone propels us to new heights on our mission to elevate the travel experience for PRM travellers, enriching lives one journey at a time,” says Mohsen. “The market opportunity for DAAV is substantial. Offering mobility services for PRM in airports is labor-intensive, expensive, and error prone. The rising demand for such services stresses the critical need for integrating DAAV-air. It is not a luxury but an essential solution to guarantee dependable and efficient assistance for PRM travellers.” (Press release / RAN)"

With CHF 10 million already invested in 41 startups, the Fund is activly working towards growing its portfolio to 70 companies this year. Kickfund Ventures Fund I is a new investment fund dedicated to enhancing Switzerland's innovation ecosystem by supporting deep tech startups that have successfully participated in the Venture Kick competition. With an initial closing of CHF 70 million, the fund aims to provide up to CHF 850,000 in funding per company, specifically targeting pre-seed and seed-stage ventures. While the Fund typically aims to invest in up to 25 startups per year, this year was an exception due to a backlog of 91 companies from previous Venture Kick ventures, dating as far back as 2021, which were considered for investment once the Fund became operational at the end of 2023. “The objective is to clear this backlog and enter the next phase of normal investment pace matching Venture Kick's ongoing turnout of Venture Kick stage 3 winners starting 2025”, clarified Wanja Humanes, CEO of KickFund. He added, “We are confident that our portfolio will grow to around 70 companies by the end of the year.” However, the fund’s investment strategy is highly systematic, not automatic. Each decision is made with careful consideration, and the fund reserves the right to decline investments when necessary, as evidenced by its recent choice to pass on two opportunities. With the goal of aligning closely with Venture Kick, the fund has accelerated its activities this year, rapidly expanding its portfolio to 41 companies across 42 investments. Notably, 38 startups have received funding within this year alone. About CHF 10 million has flown into the portfolio.

Kickfund Ventures Fund I is a new investment fund dedicated to enhancing Switzerland's innovation ecosystem by supporting deep tech startups that have successfully participated in the Venture Kick competition. With an initial closing of CHF 70 million, the fund aims to provide up to CHF 850,000 in funding per company, specifically targeting pre-seed and seed-stage ventures. While the Fund typically aims to invest in up to 25 startups per year, this year was an exception due to a backlog of 91 companies from previous Venture Kick ventures, dating as far back as 2021, which were considered for investment once the Fund became operational at the end of 2023. “The objective is to clear this backlog and enter the next phase of normal investment pace matching Venture Kick's ongoing turnout of Venture Kick stage 3 winners starting 2025”, clarified Wanja Humanes, CEO of KickFund. He added, “We are confident that our portfolio will grow to around 70 companies by the end of the year.” However, the fund’s investment strategy is highly systematic, not automatic. Each decision is made with careful consideration, and the fund reserves the right to decline investments when necessary, as evidenced by its recent choice to pass on two opportunities. With the goal of aligning closely with Venture Kick, the fund has accelerated its activities this year, rapidly expanding its portfolio to 41 companies across 42 investments. Notably, 38 startups have received funding within this year alone. About CHF 10 million has flown into the portfolio. Luya Foods has received funding twice, benefitting from the maximum amount of CHF 850'000 per company, and two other companies are already in the process of a second investment from the fund.

With CHF 10 million already invested in 41 startups, the Fund is activly working towards growing its portfolio to 70 companies this year. Kickfund Ventures Fund I is a new investment fund dedicated to enhancing Switzerland's innovation ecosystem by supporting deep tech startups that have successfully participated in the Venture Kick competition. With an initial closing of CHF 70 million, the fund aims to provide up to CHF 850,000 in funding per company, specifically targeting pre-seed and seed-stage ventures. While the Fund typically aims to invest in up to 25 startups per year, this year was an exception due to a backlog of 91 companies from previous Venture Kick ventures, dating as far back as 2021, which were considered for investment once the Fund became operational at the end of 2023. “The objective is to clear this backlog and enter the next phase of normal investment pace matching Venture Kick's ongoing turnout of Venture Kick stage 3 winners starting 2025”, clarified Wanja Humanes, CEO of KickFund. He added, “We are confident that our portfolio will grow to around 70 companies by the end of the year.” However, the fund’s investment strategy is highly systematic, not automatic. Each decision is made with careful consideration, and the fund reserves the right to decline investments when necessary, as evidenced by its recent choice to pass on two opportunities. With the goal of aligning closely with Venture Kick, the fund has accelerated its activities this year, rapidly expanding its portfolio to 41 companies across 42 investments. Notably, 38 startups have received funding within this year alone. About CHF 10 million has flown into the portfolio. Luya Foods has received funding twice, benefitting from the maximum amount of CHF 850'000 per company, and two other companies are already in the process of a second investment from the fund.

The Zurich based startup has raised two million US dollars from investors including A16Z GAMES SPEEDRUN, YCombinator and business angels. The funds will fuel product development. While quality is a critical factor in the gaming industry, the process of testing games is still manual. Studios invest countless hours in testing games for bugs, balancing gameplay, and ensuring a smooth player experience. The repetitive and manual nature of these tasks not only strains resources but can also lead to missed opportunities for innovation and improvement. Swiss startup nunu.ai is building the first multimodal AI agents to test and play games. The agents are designed to automate and enhance various aspects of game development, starting with quality assurance. Like humans, the agents can play games and reason, while providing valuable insights and feedback (see example here ). With moderate adjustments, the AI can adapt to any game. “Game testing has seen no automation so far. We want to be the first ones to bring large scale automation to the game testing field. The real strength of our technology lies in its generalizability. Our initial focus on game quality assurance and want to use it as a launch pad for further applications beyond gaming later”, says Jan Schnyder, founder of nunu.ai. Founded by Jan Schnyder, Kyrill Hux and Nicolas Muntwyler, Nunu.ai, which goes by the legal name Generai AG in Switzerland, is a hybrid company operating between Switzerland and US, with all employees based in Switzerland.

The study is expected to start in 1H 2025 in preparation for a global Phase 3 registrational study. BioVersys is a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel antibacterial products for serious life-threatening infections caused by multi-drug resistant (“MDR”) bacteria. The company’s most advanced research and development program, BV100, addresses nosocomial infections. BV100 has a novel mode of action, addressing carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) lung and blood-stream infections.

With the acquisition, XRnanotech strengthens its expertise in lithography processes and electroplating, expanding its portfolio to include microstructured products, which are used in areas such as X-ray imaging. XRnanotech AG is an award-winning Swiss high-tech start-up, founded as a spin-off from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen by physicist Dr. Florian Döring, MBA. With 14 employees, the company based at the Switzerland Innovation Park Innovaare manufactures innovative nanostructures and optics with outstanding precision for research institutions and high-tech companies worldwide. The applications of their products range from X-ray microscopy to optical communications and the semiconductor sector. Microworks began 15 years ago by producing high-quality watch parts using X-ray lithography, then expanded into X-ray optical gratings and, most recently, into TALINT, an X-ray interferometer. Microworks is located near the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany and currently employs 7 people. Under the management of CEO Dr. Florian Döring, both companies will leverage their synergies to offer customized solutions for new applications. Microworks’ products complement XRnanotech’s established portfolio in the micrometer range. This enables the Swiss high-tech company to serve customers focused on microstructures and X-ray imaging. “Through the planned integration while maintaining the Karlsruhe location, our customers will benefit from the technical expertise of both companies,” says CEO Dr. Florian Döring. “Our product range expands significantly, and we can provide customized solutions for new applications.” Dr. Joachim Schulz, founder of Microworks, adds: “With this acquisition, we ensure continuity for our existing customers while unlocking various synergy effects for new clients and new markets.” X-ray Lithography Enables Optics with High Aspect Ratios The production of the microstructures is based on various lithography processes, particularly Deep X-ray Lithography. This process allows for structures that are 20 times taller than wide – in some cases, even up to 50 to 100 times. This high aspect ratio enables exceptional performance of Karlsruhe’s X-ray optics. Additionally, this method results in very smooth sidewalls, which is particularly important for optical applications in the visible and infrared spectrum. Other lithography processes, such as electron beam, UV, and 2-photon lithography, along with gold, nickel, and nickel alloy electroplating, are also part of Microworks’ technology portfolio. High-Precision Interferometry with TALINT In addition to high-quality X-ray optical components such as apertures, gratings, X-ray lenses, beam stops, and resolution targets, XRnanotech will now also offer the TALINT series X-ray interferometers. TALINT allows imaging in three modes: absorption, phase contrast, and dark-field contrast. “This technology is unique worldwide, enabling the extraction of significantly more structural information from X-ray images,” says Dr. Joachim Schulz. “We are very excited that, with XRnanotech’s help, even more international customers will benefit from our technology.” (Press release / SK) Picture: Microworks TALINT"

R2Home was launched in 2019 as an EPFL-Spin-off project by Yohan Hadji who will be working on the industrialization of his solution with the St-Gallen-based company. Meteomatics just acquired R2Home . Founded in 2019 by Yohan Hadji, the Vaud-based project has developed an innovative glidersonde offering a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to conventional radiosondes. For decades, radiosondes carried by weather balloons have been indispensable for collecting atmospheric data. However, a major environmental and operational drawback is that balloons drift with the wind, and radiosondes are often lost in the wild. Of the 600,000 or so radiosondes launched worldwide each year, an estimated 80% are never recovered, making them costly single-use devices with a notable impact on the environment. Now dubbed the “Meteoglider” by Meteomatics , the glidersonde is an ideal complement to the startup's sustainable atmospheric sensing solutions, joining the ranks of our Meteodrone and Meteobase technologies. The Meteoglider is a 250-gram lightweight foam glider equipped with a radiosonde and a sophisticated guidance system. Carried by a weather balloon to an altitude of 30 kilometers, it collects the same high-quality atmospheric data as a conventional radiosonde. Its guidance system calculates the optimum trajectory to return to the launch site or a designated GPS position. This technology allows the Meteoglider to be reused several times, ensuring that its lithium battery and electronic components reach their full potential of hundreds of hours of operation before being properly disposed of. The Meteoglider was tested some sixty times during the summer of 2024, including ten times from Payerne, by MeteoSwiss, in collaboration with Skyguide and the Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA). Twice a day for 5 consecutive days, the glider successfully returned a radiosonde to Payerne, landing less than 15 meters from its launch point. Data quality analyses confirmed that the Meteoglider's measurements matched those of conventional radiosondes. Joining Meteomatics Contacted by Startupticker.ch, Yohan Hadji explains that Meteomatics has acquired the ultralight stratospheric glider technology developed by R2Home, all prototypes, knowledge, test flight experience and data. Meteomatics also acquired existing relationships with national meteorological services, civil aviation authorities and radiosonde manufacturers. R2Home was born 5 years ago as a high school research project, when Yohan Hadji was 15 years old. Commenting on the milestone acquisition, the founder says: “I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to learn a lot, have a lot of fun and take the technology far enough for a company like Meteomatics to acquire it. Development at Meteomatics continues in the same direction. The first big change is the opportunity to leverage Meteomatics' existing R&D and sales resources to accelerate the development and deployment of the Meteoglider. The second is that I'm still quite young and sometimes a little too doubtful. This step erases some of my doubts forever.” Yohan paused his master's degree at EPFL and joined Meteomatics to continue the technical development work on the Meteoglider. Together with his new team, Yohan hopes to be able to meet the demand for test campaigns with various national weather services in the coming month, before using the experience gained from these campaigns to propose a refined, industrialized solution in 2025.

Albatross AI-driven solutions generate engaging user journeys from recommending the right product to determining how it’s presented. Albatross solves a well-known problem that businesses face today: high churn due to outdated, uninspiring recommendations, leading to missed revenue and unhappy users. Traditional recommendation systems struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving catalogues, trends, and user interests, losing opportunities to convert users and unlock revenue. Albatross overcomes the limitations of traditional A/B testing and static personalization models, offering fully automated, real-time optimization powered by deep learning, multi-armed bandits (MABs), and reinforcement learning. This allows businesses to generate, orchestrate, and present engaging experiences that resonate with each user, recapturing otherwise lost revenue, without relying on invasive tracking. The start-up was founded by Kevin Kahn, Matteo Ruffini, and Johan Boissard, experts who led machine learning and recommendation platforms at Amazon and have a proven track record of building tech businesses at scale. ""Users want to be inspired and guided in their discovery journey,"" said Kevin Kahn, CEO. ""Most recommendation systems react to user intent, but this approach falls short in a world where catalogues and user interests evolve rapidly. To make things worse, traditional technologies over-focus on popular items, leaving most catalogues undiscovered and leading to user fatigue. Our platform ensures fresh recommendations, dynamically matching users with the right products and at the right time."" The start-up is still in development but already has a first pilot customer and is actively working on onboarding more. The funds from the pre-seed round will be used to expand the team and for operating and infrastructure costs. The round was led by redalpine and joined by Daphni and private investors. ""We’re excited to empower such an incredible team with an established track record in AI and personalization right at the inception of Albatross"", said Marc Moesser, Investor at redalpine.

The company closed a $12 million Series A funding round, led by Cherry Ventures with additional investment from existing business angels, family offices, and a conventional debt facility. This new funding brings Voliro’s total capital raised to $22 million and will accelerate the company’s mission to make industrial inspection, maintenance, and repair work at height safer, more efficient, and cost-effective. “Our mission is to eliminate the need for people to be exposed to risk for any work at height,” said Timo Müller, COO and co-founder of Voliro. “With our advanced flying robots, we’re not only making these operations safer but also more efficient and cost-effective. This new funding will enable us to expand our product offerings and bring our technology to more industries globally.” B2B subscription model for sustainable growth Voliro operates on a B2B subscription model, offering its technology as a comprehensive package that includes hardware, software, continuous updates, training, support, spare parts, and crash insurance.

Additionally, each startup is awarded financial aid amounting to EUR 200,000 to facilitate their development and growth. The latest cohort comprises the following startups: Terensis | Gregor Perich – Up to 30% of harvested crops are lost globally due to inefficiencies in the complex agri-food supply chain. Information asymmetries between stakeholders, especially around crop yields, contribute to this waste and threaten food security. Improving transparency and data-sharing across the chain could help reduce these losses. Terensis addresses this challenge with its Crop Digital Twin which combines satellite images and biophysical models to simulate the development of crops from sowing to harvest. With the ability to measure the influence of weather on agriculture, CDT can predict crop yield up to two months before harvest. Mosaic | Alfio di Mauro – is focusing on the development of ultra-low power systems on chips that combine general-purpose computing (CPUs) with hardware accelerators. The team has developed a novel approach for integrating multiple accelerators with CPUs on the same silicon. LogBook | Leonard Gölti – wants to build a Google map of logistics by providing public transport node data at scale, leveraging its proprietary data gathering and analysis system. The platform allows businesses and supply chain professionals to easily access vital information about logistic hubs, ports, and warehouses, which ultimately enables better decision-making, and improves efficiency across the entire supply chain network which will be the fundament for fully autonomous logistics operations. Riverkin | Jessica Droujko – deploys high-resolution, low-power sensor networks that measure water flow, temperature, sediment, and conductivity for dynamic freshwater monitoring in remote regions, delivering actionable insights for water quality and ecosystem health. The technology precisely detects extreme events, supporting both biodiversity metrics and the operational needs of water resource managers. Transcality | Sasan Amini – many public authorities particularly in urban areas are looking for smart mobility solutions. Transcality uses big data, cloud computing, machine learning, simulation, and automation to efficiently create digital transportation twins that offer affordable and quickly updated solutions for 21st-century challenges. The startup’s solutions include a wide array of applications ranging from traffic monitoring to more advanced analytical and predictive services. NovoViz | Andrada Muntean – is a fabless semiconductor company that designs and manufactures computation imaging sensors for applications that demand high sensitivity and high speed but cannot handle large amounts of data.

These are: Ascento : Security robots enabled by space data The security industry is currently facing a major challenge with the guard leasing model, which has low profitability (c.a. 3% net profit margin) due to the high cost of guards, and it is harder to recruit and retain guards than before. To solve this problem, Ascento offers a Robotics-as-a-Service Security Solution (RaaS) that includes a two-legged robot that performs outdoor patrols on large private premises. It can navigate rough terrain, bumps, steps, and even snow with its off-road tires. Its “head” houses the computer, battery, sensors, and AI, which allow for generating daily security reports that help improve security mechanisms. It is equipped with a thermal camera that detects people and vehicles, while the 360° camera captures images of the surroundings. The accompanying AI and Machine learning-based Ascento Security Analytics software helps the robot to detect security issues, generate reports and communicate via a live feed with a backup operator. Founded in 2020, the company is testing the solution in pilot projects. Mondaic : Revealing defects and material fatigue inside composites by listening to ultrasonic waves. The ETH Spinoff Mondaic offers modern software and services for the simulation, analysis, and inversion of mechanical as well as sound waves across all scales. Its core product Salvus is a high-performance software suite for full waveform modelling and inversion. It focuses on performing fast, accurate, and flexible simulations across all spatial scales, and includes a comprehensive toolbox covering meshing, model building, data management and full waveform inversions. Inverto : Using satellite data to improve large-scale site selection and monitoring for wetland restoration Inverto aims to automate mangrove-restoration-as-a-service for mangrove restoration groups. Mangroves are excellent carbon sinks, many times more than terrestrial forests, and are critical for biodiversity. There are currently over 800'000 hectares of mangroves that can be restored; however, the planting of mangroves is very labour intensive in difficult terrain, slowing restoration efforts and increasing restoration costs. Inverto has engineered a system that can precisely release mangrove seeds from drones, reducing planting costs and speeding up the process. Using innovative methods for data collection, Inverto also develops an intelligent site selection approach to select planting locations as well as scalable techniques for data on carbon capture and biodiversity impacts. Gravis : Autonomous construction with heavy machines for earth and space Based on more than a decade of experience in construction robotics, Gravis has developed the world’s most advanced robotic excavators with robust autonomy in extreme environments. The embedded advanced teleoperation tools ensure seamless machine control where human judgment is essential, but where on-site operation puts lives at risk. Across the construction site or the continent, their intelligent networking stack maintains secure communication with remote construction equipment. BTRY : Solid-state batteries for reliable operation in the most demanding conditions in space Founded in 2023 as a spin-off of EMPA, BTRY is leading the way with the industry‘s first energy-dense solid-state battery made with advanced semiconductor manufacturing methods, setting a new standard in the field.

The company funded the initial payment using available cash from outside of the U.S. and expects to make any future payments using these same cash balances. Except for acquisition-related expenses, this acquisition does not impact St. Jude Medical’s outlook for 2013 consolidated earnings per share. Endosense Force-Sensing Technology Endosense developed the TactiCath irrigated ablation catheter to give physicians a real-time, objective measure of the force they apply to the heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure. Without contact-force data, physicians have to estimate the amount of force applied to the heart wall during an ablation. If too little force is applied, there is a risk of incomplete lesion formation that could result in AF recurrence, potentially requiring additional treatments. If too much force is applied, there is a risk of tissue injury, which can lead to serious procedure-related complications. “Force sensing is a tremendous advancement in cardiac ablation that will potentially improve safety and efficacy, likely becoming a standard for all cardiac ablations,” said Dr. Vivek Reddy, professor of medicine and principal investigator in the TOCCASTAR trial at Mount Sinai Hospital, N.Y. “As the first and most studied force-sensing catheter on the market, TactiCath now provides St. Jude Medical with a best-in-class ablation catheter.” There is a growing body of evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of contact-force ablation technology, including Endosense’s TOCCATA, EFFICAS I and EFFICAS II studies, which have collectively demonstrated safety and reduced rate of AF recurrence when contact force was used. TactiCath is CE Mark approved for atrial fibrillation (AF) and supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) ablation. In addition, Endosense just completed its U.S. IDE trial – the TOCCASTAR trial – and plans to submit its pre-market approval application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of a paroxysmal AF indication before the end of 2013. ""TactiCath offers important improvements over previous-generation ablation catheters,” said Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz Kuck, director of cardiology at St. Georg Hospital in Hamburg, Germany. “While low contact force can lead to ineffective lesions, excessive contact force can cause safety concerns. The ability to more precisely measure this force improves procedural efficiency and provides increased confidence that an ablation will be effective in treating complex cardiac arrhythmias."" Strategic Benefits for St. Jude Medical The acquisition of Endosense is highly complementary to the St. Jude Medical business. The Endosense force sensing technology provides a strong, patent-protected platform for future product development. Immediate opportunities to integrate this technology into other proprietary St. Jude Medical technologies include the potential to offer a MediGuide-enabled force-sensing ablation catheter and to incorporate force sensing data into the company’s EnSite Velocity™ Mapping System. In addition, St. Jude Medical’s global presence and geographic distribution scale can further strengthen and enhance Endosense’s international growth in a number of markets. “The acquisition of Endosense further strengthens our industry-leading portfolio of products to treat patients with cardiac arrhythmias, and provides an opportunity to accelerate our market share capture in the $900 million global cardiac ablation catheter market,” said Frank J. Callaghan, president of the Cardiovascular and Ablation Technologies Division of St. Jude Medical. “This transaction significantly accelerates our timeline to providing an irrigated ablation catheter that incorporates force sensing in both international and U.S. markets, and has potential future applications across other St. Jude Medical technology platforms as well.” In connection with this transaction, BofA Merrill Lynch is acting as financial advisor and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Homburger AG as legal advisors to St. Jude Medical. Perella Weinberg Partners is acting as financial advisor and Baker & McKenzie is acting as legal counsel to Endosense. About Endosense Founded in Geneva in 2003, Endosense is a medical technology company focused on improving the efficacy, safety and accessibility of catheter ablation for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The company pioneered the use of Contact Force measurement in catheter ablation with the development of the TactiCath, the industry’s first force-sensing ablation catheter. Endosense is backed by Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners, NeoMed Management, Gimv, VI Partners, Sectoral Asset Management, Ysios Capital Partners, Initiative Capital Romandie and NGN Capital."

A planned 60-patient, randomized and controlled Phase 2 Proof-of-concept trial of VS-01 in ACLF is expected to launch in the fourth quarter 2022. Versantis’ VS-02 is a pre-clinical oral, small molecule drug candidate being developed for the chronic management of HE (hepatic encephalopathy), considered an endemic disease worldwide. HE is a nervous system disorder brought on by advanced chronic liver disease. GENFIT will also be able to develop TS-01, a unique point-of-care diagnostic device in prototype development for the at-home measurement of ammonia in the blood, the primary cause of HE. CHF40 million due at closing The deal includes an initial consideration of CHF40 million due at closing, with contingent consideration of up to CHF65 million upon positive Phase 2 results for VS-01 and VS-02 and regulatory approval of VS-01. In addition, Versantis is eligible to receive 1/3 of the net proceeds resulting from the potential sale of the Pediatric Review Voucher of VS-01’s pediatric application by GENFIT to a third party, or 1/3 of the fair market value of this Voucher if GENFIT opts to apply it to one of its own programs. GENFIT will finance the base acquisition consideration from its current cash and cash equivalents. The deal should be completed during the fourth quarter 2022, following completion of the consultation of GENFIT’s employees representative bodies. GENFIT, fouded in 1999 in northern France, has facilities in Lille and Paris, France, and Cambridge, MA, USA. GENFIT is a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and on compartment B of Euronext’s regulated market in Paris. On Friday, 16 September the company was valued at EUR 200 million. GENFIT’s R&D is focused on three franchises: cholestatic diseases, Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and NASH diagnostics. In its cholestatic diseases franchise, ELATIVE, a Phase 3 global trial evaluating elafibranor in patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is well underway following a successful Phase 2 clinical trial. Topline data is expected to be announced in the second quarter 2023. In 2021, GENFIT signed an exclusive licensing agreement with IPSEN to develop, manufacture and commercialize elafibranor in PBC and other indications. GENFIT is also developing GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma following the acquisition of exclusive rights in this indication from Genoscience Pharma in 2021. In ACLF, a Phase 1 clinical program with nitazoxanide has been initiated in 2021. As part of its diagnostic solutions franchise, the Company entered into an agreement with Labcorp in 2021 to commercialize NASHnext, powered by GENFIT’s proprietary diagnostic technology NIS4 in identifying at-risk NASH.

With the integration of the Mira solution, JAROWA’s clients profit from fully automated coverage checks, damage calculation and a wide range of analytical data insights to improve their business. Founded in 2017 in Zug, Jarowa offers insurance companies, property managers, and leasing companies access to a digital marketplace in mobility, property & trades, healthcare, and legal advice. In the case of a claim under insurance, the claim is automatically assessed, and an appropriate and trusted service provider is selected and commissioned to handle the order. The settling of the claim is processed digitally for all parties involved. After reaching “market standard” status in its home market of Switzerland, JAROWA has successfully expanded into European markets and counts leading insurances, property managers and leasing companies among their clients. The recent closure of their Series A financing round for more than CHF 12 million is accelerating JAROWA’s growth outside Switzerland. To enhance its offering, Jarowa has fully integrated Mira (formally Mitra Solutions AG), a Winterthur-based startup founded in 2018 by Dandolo Flumini, Joris Morger, Nicolas Gagliani and Alberto Ribeiro Silveira. Mira’s solution contains a visual drag-and-drop contract builder for the simple digitisation of insurance products and the associated policy wording (in particular its terms & conditions) into a “smart contract”. Enabling a fully digital, end-to-end claims process In the event of a claim, the smart contract dynamically displays only those questions that are relevant for each individual case. Existing damage reports support the automated check of the coverage calculation and the resulting payment of the claim. Running the claims processes with the Mira solution significantly reduces the effort of manually assessing a claim, and the payments are accurate and fully in line with the policy wording. Additional features, such as automatic value estimation of damaged goods, digital validation of notified events (hail, theft, etc,), smart data insights, customer interaction monitoring and the integrated scenario simulation facility, provide insurance companies with vast amounts of structured data to further improve their processes and products. After onboarding the Mira solution, Jarowa’s customers can report their claims to their insurance company by using a customer self-service portal or with the support of a call centre agent. Mira’s smart contract engine safely guides the user through the relevant - and dynamically created - notification questionnaire in order to assess and calculate the coverage. Insurance customers then receive an instant cover assessment and, whenever possible, a direct settlement option. A service provider is mandated via the JAROWA platform if damage needs to be repaired. In addition to the strong benefits of Mira in day-to-day operations and customer interaction, Mira can also help insurers to overcome employee capacity shortages during peak seasons and surge events, such as storms, hail, or flooding. Through its high level of automation, insurers can quickly process many claims related to the same event or even temporarily move the event to a full self-servicing channel specifically activated. Mira becomes Jarowa’s subsidiary The acquisition of Mira builds on the startup’s existing relationship, as the two have conducted several successful projects with them since Q3 2021. Mitra Solutions is now a fully-owned subsidiary of JAROWA AG and will be marketed under the JAROWA brand. Andreas Akeret, JAROWA CEO, states, “We are delighted to be able to offer our clients a fully digital claims process. Access to an automated coverage check and claims calculation solution is a game changer for insurance companies. The service seamlessly connects to our digital vendor marketplace, turning claims handling into a truly digital, end-to-end process. Mira has built the bridge between Claims, Product-Design and Underwriting. We are delighted that the talented Mira team has decided to join our company.” (RAN)"

Over the years, the company has sold over 100,000 units and recycled over 191'120 cement bags. Surs GmbH has now acquired all assets of Elephbo, including the majority of the team, which will continue growing the brand. Nicolas Huxley (right) established Elephbo to create an ecological impact in Cambodia by recycling masses of cement bags that had been poorly disposed around on building sites, garbage dumps or on meadows and roads. The cement bags became an ideal raw material for the Elephbo brand due to their stable plastic fabric. The Zurich-based startup, Huxley Design AG, has recycled 191'123 cement bags today and sold more than 100’000 high-end consumer products, including backpacks, bags, sneakers and a wide range of accessories. In addition to helping solve the environmental problem, Elephbo aimed to enhance the welfare of Cambodians by educating its workers, providing social benefits and paying fair wages. “We were also able to help set up a production facility in Cambodia, which now offers more than 500 people secure and well-paid jobs”, said Nicolas. Despite having a rollercoaster journey, the startup has achieved several milestones, including setting up activities in Switzerland, Bosnia and Cambodia, securing capital and becoming a profitable company in 2021. The startup also grew the team to 13 people: five in Switzerland and eight in Cambodia. “After a very difficult 2020, I was proud to keep the team together and come back strong in 2021, mainly due to a clearer focus on our product portfolio and sales strategy. 2021 was our first profitable year since our seed funding round in 2018, primarily because we said no to many opportunities.” Surs GmbH has taken over the impact startup and acquired all assets owned by Huxley Design AG. Surs has been building e-commerce brands since 2017 and has a close strategic alliance with Digt AG , which has built closed e-commerce platforms for various large communities. Surs’s experience and setup allow Elephbo to leverage many synergies, outsource back office work, and focus on its core business, creating impactful products. Following the acquisition, the production and sales will remain the same, as well as all projects in Cambodia. Additionally, most team members of the Elephbo team will stay with the company and activities in Cambodia will remain unchanged. Reflecting on his startup journey, Nicolas said to Startupticker that he benefited from offers provided by support organisations like the Entrepreneur Organisation (EO) and the Swiss Startup Association. Moreover, social media platforms like LinkedIn and meeting and sharing ideas and experiences with founders in similar fields enabled him to learn and grow his brand. One of his major learnings has been learning to say no. “Only focus on what brings you closer to your vision. Knowing that good things take time, keep your mind open, but don't let everything that's happening around you distract you”, he advises.

Smart glasses have huge potential for the future of mobile computing and visual augmented reality. However existing see-through near-eye display technologies- the central technology in smart glasses- have extremely difficult trade-offs. Current see-through displays aimed at the consumer market are either too small in image size for augmented reality (for example Google Glass), or too bulky to be practical. Further, aesthetics are of crucial importance and all existing wearable display technologies fall short of the ideal: discreet and normal looking eyewear. Composyt’s solution is a patented see-through display architecture invented at EPFL. The display integrates discreetly with normal eyewear, enabling a new generation of aesthetic smart glasses. The technolgy has several important advantages: stylish normal-looking eyeware large image size very high transparency, no see-throug aberrations can work in combination with prescription glasses.

Its technology will allow Coalition, the leading cyber insurance provider for small and midsize businesses, to offer 24/7 security monitoring to safeguard an organization in addition to insurance coverage. Although the recent data breaches at Facebook, Capital One, and Travelex dominate the news, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) are the most frequent targets of cyber attacks. More than 30 million SMBs in the U.S. alone are online everyday, and yet most lack the tools to protect themselves. SMBs are also the least equipped to recover from a cyber attack, where the financial and operational consequences can be devastating. The BinaryEdge Internet data collection platform continuously scans the entire global Internet, mapping the Internet attack surface of over 5 billion devices across over 15 million business entities, allowing BinaryEdge to provide any organization with real-time threat intelligence to help reduce their cyber risk. Coalition , a leading provider of cyber insurance in the United States, will integrate BinaryEdge’s technology with its cyber insurance and security platform, allowing Coalition policyholders to easily map their Internet attack surface, monitor risk exposures in real-time, and proactively fix vulnerabilities so that they can stay one step ahead of their adversaries. The result for Coalition policyholders is far lower costs to detect, contain, and recover from a data breach, and fewer losses and claims. “While most insurers only respond after an incident, Coalition is now uniquely positioned to provide organizations with the data and tools they need to prevent and mitigate losses before they occur,” said Joshua Motta, CEO of Coalition. “Coalition is the only provider of cyber insurance to truly combine cybersecurity with insurance, working with policyholders as a dedicated risk management partner before, during and after an incident.” Effective immediately, Coalition is using BinaryEdge’s Internet scanning technology to continuously monitor the over 10,000 and growing organizations that have selected Coalition as their insurance provider. Every day, Coalition maps and scans each policyholder’s Internet attack surface, finds risk exposures and vulnerabilities, and provides real-time threat intelligence and alerts to reduce the likelihood that an organization is compromised. Coalition customers are often notified and informed how to fix a vulnerability in a manner of hours, a process which previously took most organizations weeks or months. “The security paradigm is changing. Hackers are moving faster than the most sophisticated security professionals can respond,” said Tiago Henriques, CEO and founder of BinaryEdge. “In this new world, the accuracy of security information and the speed of remediation are critical, and as important as maintaining proper security protocols in the first place. We’re thrilled to join the most advanced provider of cyber insurance in the market to democratize access to these tools.” (Press release / SK)"

The acquisition allows Snyk to boost its platform supporting over 1.5 million developers by integrating and building on DeepCode’s AI engine to help quickly and accurately identify vulnerabilities in codes. DeepCode was established in 2016 with the ambition to provide a machine learning-driven platform for automated AI code reviews which alerts developers about critical vulnerabilities. With the increasing dependence on software, the importance of ensuring that software is written in a way that makes it easy to maintain and adapt while being reliable and efficient is equally essential. DeepCode’s platform, which is built on more than a decade of research, helps developers to prevent bugs from going into production by scanning code up to 50x faster than alternatives. DeepCode not only provides the most accurate but also the fastest solution enabling real-time workflows. Despite the successes of the past years, which include the closing of a CHF 3.92 million, DeepCode would require several years to launch its solution in the market. One of the reasons being that the team had dedicated their skills elsewhere but preparing for commercialisation, according to a blog by Earlybird Venture Capita l, which led DeepCode’s investment round last year. The initial partnership discussions with Snyk, therefore quickly revealed more substantial synergies. DeepCode has now agreed to merge with Snyk , the leader in developer-first cloud-native application security. The deal is expected to close within two months, following satisfaction of customary pre-closing conditions. As a global player in its field, Snyk supports over 1.5 million active user developer community and are primed for commercial distribution, with a total funding of USD 450 million and its recent valuation skyrocketing to USD 2.65 billion. DeepCode’s intelligence will strengthen Synk’s platform by helping to more quickly identify vulnerabilities and ensure developers have a superior level of accuracy. The acquisition of DeepCode comes on the heels of Snyk’s September 9th announcement of a $200 million Series D investment and valuation of $2.6B . Building on a year of extraordinary growth, including more than 275% revenue growth and 100% employee growth, Snyk will continue its rapid expansion and product innovation with the addition of the DeepCode team and technology. “Traditional security tools are fatally flawed in today’s fast-paced development environment”, said Peter McKay, CEO of Snyk. “They are too slow for developers to use in their daily work, and they result in too many false positives, often leading to wasted time or overlooked threats. DeepCode’s AI engine brings a level of speed and accuracy to Snyk’s technology platform that will give customers a level of security intelligence they have never had before. Additionally, we now can apply those capabilities to the proprietary code written by developers, extending the Snyk platform’s coverage for securing cloud-native applications.” ""Core to our focus at DeepCode was creating a sophisticated AI platform that blends advanced machine learning algorithms and semantic analysis which makes scanning of code lightning-fast and incredibly accurate,"" said Boris Paskalev , CEO of DeepCode.  ""By leveraging Snyk's security expertise and comprehensive vulnerability database to train our engine, our accuracy will become better even faster, and we can reduce false positives to near-zero.  This provides massive productivity benefits for developers and security teams and overall risk reduction.""

The advanced software analytics have been integrated into the ABB Ability Digital Enterprise portfolio and deliver value to ABB’s industrial customers spanning the power, transportation, telecommunications, natural-resources sectors and other asset-intensive industries. Accurate forecasting The enhanced prognostic functionality has been gained through the integration of recently acquired software firm Cassantec’s analytics within the Digital Enterprise portfolio. New features include condition-based prognostic horizons and risk profiles alongside simulation capabilities that extends an operator’s monitoring and diagnostic capabilities into the future - from fleet level all the way to individual assets. This industry-leading functionality drives business value by minimizing downtime and avoiding asset failure, reducing maintenance and operational costs. In addition, the prognostics functions deliver scenario analysis functionality over explicit future time horizons, greatly enhancing a company’s ability to optimize asset maintenance and replacement plans. “By embedding Cassantec’s powerful prognostics into our industry-leading Ellipse® APM product, part of the company’s Digital Enterprise, we are strengthening the value proposition we offer to our customers as their partner of choice as they embark on their digitization journey,” said Massimo Danieli, head of ABB’s grid automation business line in the company’s Power Grids business. “By deepening and expanding analytical insight into asset performance and optimization, our APM solution drives even more value for our customers from the board room to the field.” Cassantec software: proven track record Cassantec’s field-proven technology accurately predicted 99 percent of equipment malfunctions with a time horizon of as long as 5 years, and that this accuracy rate increases over time through the data-driven machine-learning capabilities of its software. For client operators of fossil-fueled power plants, for example, Cassantec can provide annual savings of millions of euros per gigawatt of generation capacity. In addition to improving commercial strategies and reputation, an additional benefit of the prognostics is in retaining expert knowledge as the global industrial workforce matures. Employees of Cassantec, based in Berlin and Zurich, joined ABB’s Enterprise Software product group within its Power Grids business beginning in the third quarter of 2019."

Our investors are very happy about the deal. The fact that Carbon Delta had multiple bidders in the acquisition process underlines the high quality of this startup. It was my pleasure to help the founders not only during the seed round but also during the exit negotiations”, says Thomas Dübendorfer, President and co-founder of Swiss ICT Investor Club ( SICTIC ). Daniel Schoch, Head of Start-up Finance at Zürcher Kantonalbank , remarks: ""The impact of climate change on portfolio companies is an increasingly important issue for asset managers. Carbon Delta enables them to comprehensively assess these future costs and therefore enhance their investment decisions. We are proud that this compelling solution has prompted MSCI to build a Climate Risk Center in Zurich. Congratulations to the team – working with you has always been a pleasure."" Innovative new climate risk metric The Carbon Delta integration will expand MSCI’s robust suite of climate risk capabilities with state-of-the-art modeling technology that supports climate scenario analysis and forward-looking assessment of transition and physical risks, as well as extensive company-level analysis of publicly traded companies globally. This will be offered as MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk, an innovative and pioneering climate risk metric that calculates the impact of climate change on a company’s market value and helps investors understand and quantify these risks within their portfolio. “We believe climate change will become one of the most important investment factors over the long term. Institutional investors should be able to analyze the exposure of their portfolios to climate risk while also being able to report on their climate strategy,” said Remy Briand, Head of ESG at MSCI. “We are pleased to come together with Carbon Delta to provide our clients with state-of-the-art climate risk analysis capabilities that can help shape investment management practices of the future.” “Carbon Delta has aimed to create the best climate change scenario analytics for financial institutions,” said Dr. Oliver Marchand, CEO of Carbon Delta. “We are very excited to join forces with MSCI to mature and grow our products. Combining Carbon Delta’s scenario analysis and MSCI’s products is what institutional investors have been asking for.” The transaction is expected to close within the next month, subject to customary closing conditions.

With more than 76 biologic drug development programs and three commercial products utilizing its cell lines, Selexis has a history of empowering scientists and biopharmaceutical companies around the world to realize the potential of their research. JSR Life Sciences ( JLS ) announced today that JSR Corporation has agreed to acquire Selexis SA, a pioneering life sciences company and global leader in mammalian (suspension-adapted CHO-K1) cell-line generation technologies. Once completed, this transaction will mark the second major biotechnology addition to the JSR group of companies following JSR Corporation’s acquisition of KBI Biopharma in 2015. Selexis will be integrated within KBI Biopharma’s operations to create the most robust and fastest “Gene to GMP” service offering in the biopharmaceutical industry.

Symetis looks back to an eventful history: The company was founded in 2001 as a spin-off from ETH Zurich. In 2006 however Symetis started a second time with a new technology and moved from Zurich to Lausanne. In 2015 an IPO at the Swiss Exchange was announced and later postponed. A month ago Symetis announced again plan to go public, this time at Euronext. This IPO will also not take place. Symetis will be acquired by Boston Scientific for almost half a billion Dollars in cash. Symetis is a medical technology company specializing in the development, manufacturing and marketing of percutaneous heart valve replacement solutions for the treatment of severe cardiac valve conditions. Growing at a strong and sustained CAGR of 55% since 2012, the company generated revenues of CHF 38.4 million in 2016. The acquisition of Symetis by Boston Scientific will allow the company to extend its reach and expand the treatment offerings for patients with aortic valvular heart disease worldwide. The combination of Symetis' ACURATE valves with the Boston Scientific Lotus™ valve platform, will also enable interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to address varying patient pathologies and anatomies with two complementary and compelling technologies. Jacques R. Essinger, Ph.D. and CEO, Symetis, commented ""Over the past years, Symetis matured into a TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) player with fast growth and a solid clinical reputation. The IPO that we were pursuing until yesterday on Euronext Paris was meant to give Symetis the means to commercially expand beyond Europe and to further grow into the exciting field of structural heart. We are very pleased by the positive response we received from the investment community, which we want to thank for the interest it has shown in Symetis. However, as of today, the company is taking another path by joining Boston Scientific. The global scale and strong legacy of Boston Scientific in interventional cardiology will further propel Symetis' clinical excellence. As a result, we can expect more patients to be better treated for valvular heart disease globally. Moving forward, this means an exciting development path for the Symetis team."" Dominik Ellenrieder, Symetis' Chairman, added ""Growing at a strong and sustained CAGR of 55% since 2012, Symetis is a success story in the structural heart market. This purchase agreement is a recognition of Symetis' research and development track record in addressing patients' needs with innovative structural heart technologies, the company's manufacturing expertise and its strong relationships with doctors and healthcare professionals. We are excited about the strong potential of our combined strengths to set a new standard in the TAVI market with a broad and clinically differentiated offering."" Following the purchase agreement reached with Boston Scientific, the IPO launched on 20 March 2017 by Symetis on Euronext Paris, very well received by the investment community and which was originally expected to be completed on 31 March 2017, has been halted.

For the ENATA Industries Group, buyer of the Lausanne business, the acquistion of the design office brings a strategic value to its Marine and Aerospace subsidiaries, and accelerates its arrival on new markets. The adventure of the Swiss start-up began in 2005 by the rescue of the Hydroptère project, stalled at this time; and the pursuit of a dream, breaking the world speed sailing record. Thierry Lombard took the project under his wing and gave to it, beyond the financial support, a genuine scientific dimension.

In November 8, 2009, after years of intensive research, failures and several back and forth by the Decision shipyard, the foiling trimaran crossed the mythical 50 knots speed and was recognized as the fastest sail in the world. Beyond the outstanding athletic performance, it's the applied research and the transmission to everyone the private banker is looking for. Consequently, the pace of projects is accelerating, with the construction of the laboratory boat Hydros.ch, the C Class catamarans, capable of traveling at three times the speed of the wind, and the development of an advanced hydrodynamics simulation software.

Inositec purchase price includes an upfront payment of CHF 20 million and success based clinical earn-out payments. Inositec’s lead vascular calcification inhibitor, INS-3001, is being developed to treat indications of high unmet medical need and has obtained approval for its phase-I trial, with the first healthy volunteer to be dosed on November 30, 2021. If successful, the plan is to initiate two phase-II programs in 2023, one in non-dialysis CKD patients suffering from PAD, and a separate trial in patients suffering from AVS, a serious condition whereby the aortic valves calcify to the extent that surgical intervention is the only available option. Vifor Pharma , global pharmaceuticals company headquartered in Switzerland, and listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, will acquire 100% of the shares in Inositec AG, receiving full global rights for the lead asset INS-3001. Inositec will receive an upfront payment of CHF 20 million and be eligible for success based clinical earn-out payments in the low triple digit million range. Closing of the Inositec transaction is expected to occur still in Q4 2021. Investors in Inositec include ZKB and VI Partners. Inositec, a spin-off from ETH Zurich was founded in 2015. Inositec’s novel asset INS-3001, is a once-daily subcutaneous treatment for patients with vascular calcification disorders PAD and AVS, which are both major contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in affected patient populations. With INS-3001 daily subcutaneous dosing, patients with earlier stages of vascular calcification can be optimally treated, while end-stage kidney disease patients will benefit from the three times per week dosing regimen of SNF472. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive vascular calcific disorder particularly common in chronic kidney disease patients and characterized by stenosis of arteries in the lower extremities causing reduced blood flow to the legs. Patients present with recurrent fatigue or pain that is known as intermittent claudication, which causes a poor quality of life. Progressive PAD requires vascular surgery to reduce the risk for limb amputation. Aortic Valve Stenosis (AVS) is a progressive deterioration of the aortic valve, which can only be treated by implantation of a new valve. AVS occurs when the orifice of the aortic valve is significantly reduced due to calcification. This causes an effective increase in afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy and, eventually, symptoms of congestive heart failure. (Press release / SK) Source photo: Vifor Pharma"

The acquisition underscores the Novartis commitment to finding treatments for patients with severe vision loss and the potential of optogenetics as the basis of successful therapeutics. Arctos Medical developed its technology as a potential method for treating inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) and other diseases that involve photoreceptor loss, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Existing gene therapy treatments aim to correct a specific gene, so only a small subset of patients can benefit. The Arctos technology is not limited to a specific gene, and thus can potentially address many forms of IRDs regardless of the underlying mutation. Arctos’ proprietary, light-sensitive optogene is delivered to specific retinal cells using gene therapy, thus turning the targeted cells into replacement photoreceptor-like cells. If successful, a therapeutic based on such a technology could be used to treat any disease that causes blindness due to photoreceptor death. The Arctos technology was based on discoveries by its scientific co-founders Sonja Kleinlogel and Michiel van Wyk of University of Bern. Arctos was originally incubated by +ND Capital and was later supported by Novartis Venture Fund through a Series A financing round led by +ND Capital. IRDs, which impact more than 2 million people globally and often result in complete blindness, can be caused by mutations in over 100 different genes. AMD is the leading cause of visual disability, affecting an estimated 170 million people globally. There are no curative therapies currently available for AMD. “Optogenetics is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach that might restore sight to patients who are legally blind,” said Jay Bradner, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. “The Arctos technology builds on our conviction that optogenetic gene therapies may meaningfully help patients battling devastating eye diseases.” (Press release / SK)"

The primary focus is to optimize visual field and perimetry testing, a critical step in preventing blindness caused by glaucoma. The spin-off from the University of Bern closed a first tranche of its seed round. By developing a portfolio of virtual eye tests conducted on commercial VR headsets, PeriVision is transforming eye care. Doctors can easily configure and analyze the test results on a cloud platform, employing AI algorithms to optimize eye tests, assist patients autonomously, ensure quality control, and provide valuable insights for clinical decisions. This approach enhances productivity in clinics, optimizes treatment decisions, and expands access to eye care. Serife Kucur, the CTO of PeriVision, emphasizes the company's long-term vision to develop a holistic platform comprising various eye tests and AI tools that assist clinicians in their daily work. This ambitious goal has garnered significant interest from private practices, hospitals, and medical technology distributors, who are eager to purchase the system, conduct research, or bring it to market. Last year, the startup secured EUR 1.5 million in pre-seed funding from the EIT Health Wild Card accelerator, a convertible loan from Venture Kick, and a substantial research grant from the Swiss government's Innosuisse program. These resources facilitated the building of their first product and conducting essential clinical studies. In May 2023, the company based at Biopôle successfully closed the first tranche of a seed round, raising CHF 0.5-1.0M to further accelerate research and development, and prepare for the launch of their inaugural product in Q1 2024. Various investors participated in the seed round, including early-stage VC, DART Ventures , experienced angel investors from the founders' network and SICTIC . In addition Fondation pour l'Innovation Technologique ( FIT ) and the Biopôle Startup Fund support Perivision. Notably, Walter Inäbnit, the former owner and chairman of leading ophthalmic device manufacturer Haag-Streit Group, will join PeriVision as a board observer. Inäbnit, a respected figure in the industry, believes in the company's potential to revolutionize ophthalmology and improve both clinical practice and patient care. “Bringing innovation into ophthalmology to improve clinical practice and patient care has been the work of my life at Haag-Streit. PeriVision shares the same vision. They want to make eye care much more accessible to patients and the lives of eye doctors easier. But to make an impact you do not just need great technology, patents and research, which they have – but also commercial experience and an understanding of the industry. This is what I hope to contribute to the young company.” Arijana Walcott from DART Ventures, specializing in bringing European deep-tech startups to the US market, highlighted the rationale behind their investment in PeriVision's eye care platform: “With billions of people impacted by vision impairments, many of which could have been prevented, the need for timely diagnosis and treatment is crucial. Perivision’s mission to provide deeper insight into eye diseases and make eye care affordable and accessible resonates deeply with us. We at DART were impressed by the team’s expertise, professionalism, and the significant advancements they have made in AI research. With their patented solution and access to valuable data sets, Perivision has a unique advantage in the market.” As PeriVision prepares to enter the markets in the United States and Europe in 2024, the management team eagerly collaborates with investors who contribute not only capital but also expertise and enthusiasm for a shared vision.

The company has secured three substantial grants totalling over CHF 1.3 million from various organisations including Innosuisse, Target ALS, and the ALS Association. The company has since its inception raised a total of CHF 33.5 million in equity and non-dilutive funding. Allergies, driven by a malfunctioning immune system, are increasingly prevalent and pose significant social and economic challenges, with severe cases like peanut allergy potentially leading to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Since its foundation in 2015, Mabylon has been tackling this challenge by harnessing the therapeutic potential of naturally occurring human antibodies to treat allergies, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. Human-derived antibodies have superior therapeutic potential compared to antibodies derived from conventional sources, such as humanized animal models or artificial libraries. With MY006, the company is developing an anti-allergen multispecific antibody targeting peanut allergy, derived from allergic patients to generate target disease-relevant allergenic determinants. This drug candidate is currently undergoing Investigative New Drug (IND) studies and will subsequently enter clinical development in Q4 2025 in collaboration with Pfizer through the Pfizer Ignite program. Mabylon retains all rights to its product and maintains independence in the decision process. Mabylon is also collaborating with SciNeuro Pharmaceuticals on multiple targets that encompass serious neurological diseases including TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) for neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no effective treatments. Both TDP-43 and APOE have human genetic evidence causal to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of their agreement, SciNeuro will have rights to develop and commercialize the resulting product(s) within Greater China and an option to expand such rights to become worldwide. While the details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the company has shared that it received an upfront payment and is eligible for milestone and royalty payments. These programs have been funded through multiple financing rounds, with the recent series A round in May 2023 resulting in a total of CHF 29 million invested in the company in addition to CHF 4.3 million in grants from several organisations. With a team of 22 employees, the company is currently fundraising for its Series B round to take its lead program to clinical development and the following program to IND filing. New grants to fast-track TDP-43 antibodies The company has obtained additional funding from Target ALS and the ALS Association to accelerate the development of TDP-43 intrabodies. The potential of this research is underscored by Dr. Kuldip Dave, Senior Vice President of Research at the ALS Association, who emphasized the importance of TDP-43 as a prime target for treating both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Additionally, Innosuisse has granted CHF 0.8 million to further develop Mabylon's MY012 program, with the University of Zurich, supervised by Prof. Michael Scharl as research partner and Mabylon as the implementation partner. MY012 centers on a proprietary, inflammasome-targeting antibody therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This therapy promises superior safety and efficacy in treating IBD, a condition that affects millions worldwide. “We are very grateful for these grants, which will help us achieve preclinical proof-of-concept for these two programs through research collaborations with renowned top experts in the respective fields,” said Alcide Barberis, PhD, CEO of Mabylon. “The goal is to then rapidly progress the programs into clinical development in partnership with biopharmaceutical companies or by creating an asset-specific spinoff with dedicated investments.

The secured funds from existing and new investors such as Silicon Valley-based Kapor Capital allow the Swiss-Kenyan startup to broaden its program across Kenya. This step is supported by the recent partnership with one of Kenya's largest health insurance companies. According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), Maternal mortality remains a major health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the continent accounting for approximately 70% of all global maternal deaths. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in this region was estimated at 531 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, a stark contrast to the global target of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This challenge underscores a critical need for enhanced healthcare access and quality. Building on his experience building companies, serial entrepreneur Pascal Koenig and his colleagues in Kenya established Malaica to address this predicament. Malaica is a comprehensive platform dedicated to supporting women during pregnancy and motherhood, offering a range of services designed to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience throughout this transformative journey. The company provides an antenatal and postnatal care program that includes monthly physical checkups, birth preparation classes, and consultations with specialists, ensuring both mother and baby receive essential care. Additionally, Malaica offers tailored delivery packages, including expertly guided vaginal and caesarean deliveries, prioritizing safety and compassionate support. The platform also features an online support program, allowing users to access personalized care from nurse-midwives and gynaecologists, as well as connect with other mothers through private support groups, fostering a strong sense of community. Ultimately, Malaica aims to make the pregnancy journey safe and joyful for millions of expecting mothers. So far, the company has supported 261,000 Kenyan women with free educational contents and 1,811 women within its paid program. Beyond the created impact, Malaica has been able to grow its revenue by around 10% month over month since its launch two years ago. In a recent pre-seed round, Malaica raised more than 1 million CHF from high-level business angels and family offices, including Kapor Capital — a Silicon Valley based VC with a wealth of experience in maternal health. The funds will be used to accelerate its growth. “Our ambition is to reduce maternal mortality, which is 100 times higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than it is in Europe. However, we feel that we can only scale our solution to millions of women if our service is financially sustainable. After lots of iterations, we are getting to a position where both impact and financials start to make sense. This is a great basis for fast further scaling”, said Pascal. B2B focus: roll out partnership with Britam Insurance To support its scaling ambitions, Malaica has joined forces with Britam Insurance, one of Kenya's largest health insurers with subsidiaries in seven other African countries. This partnership aims to further roll out the Malaica program for both higher and lower income populations. Image: Malaica's team (RAN)"

The company has secured three substantial grants totalling over CHF 1.3 million from various organisations including Innosuisse, Target ALS, and the ALS Association. The company has since its inception raised a total of CHF 33.5 million in equity and non-dilutive funding. Allergies, driven by a malfunctioning immune system, are increasingly prevalent and pose significant social and economic challenges, with severe cases like peanut allergy potentially leading to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Since its foundation in 2015, Mabylon has been tackling this challenge by harnessing the therapeutic potential of naturally occurring human antibodies to treat allergies, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. Human-derived antibodies have superior therapeutic potential compared to antibodies derived from conventional sources, such as humanized animal models or artificial libraries. With MY006, the company is developing an anti-allergen multispecific antibody targeting peanut allergy, derived from allergic patients to generate target disease-relevant allergenic determinants. This drug candidate is currently undergoing Investigative New Drug (IND) studies and will subsequently enter clinical development in Q4 2025 in collaboration with Pfizer through the Pfizer Ignite program. Mabylon retains all rights to its product and maintains independence in the decision process. Mabylon is also collaborating with SciNeuro Pharmaceuticals on multiple targets that encompass serious neurological diseases including TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) for neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no effective treatments. Both TDP-43 and APOE have human genetic evidence causal to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease. Under the terms of their agreement, SciNeuro will have rights to develop and commercialize the resulting product(s) within Greater China and an option to expand such rights to become worldwide. While the details of the transaction remain undisclosed, the company has shared that it received an upfront payment and is eligible for milestone and royalty payments. These programs have been funded through multiple financing rounds, with the recent series A round in May 2023 resulting in a total of CHF 29 million invested in the company in addition to CHF 4.3 million in grants from several organisations. With a team of 22 employees, the company is currently fundraising for its Series B round to take its lead program to clinical development and the following program to IND filing. New grants to fast-track TDP-43 antibodies The company has obtained additional funding from Target ALS and the ALS Association to accelerate the development of TDP-43 intrabodies. The potential of this research is underscored by Dr. Kuldip Dave, Senior Vice President of Research at the ALS Association, who emphasized the importance of TDP-43 as a prime target for treating both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Additionally, Innosuisse has granted CHF 0.8 million to further develop Mabylon's MY012 program, with the University of Zurich, supervised by Prof. Michael Scharl as research partner and Mabylon as the implementation partner. MY012 centers on a proprietary, inflammasome-targeting antibody therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This therapy promises superior safety and efficacy in treating IBD, a condition that affects millions worldwide. “We are very grateful for these grants, which will help us achieve preclinical proof-of-concept for these two programs through research collaborations with renowned top experts in the respective fields,” said Alcide Barberis, PhD, CEO of Mabylon. “The goal is to then rapidly progress the programs into clinical development in partnership with biopharmaceutical companies or by creating an asset-specific spinoff with dedicated investments. At Mabylon, we are currently focusing our efforts on the clinical development of our innovative anti-allergen antibody product candidates.” (Press release/RAN)"

With initial funding of $63 million, Neurosterix will acquire a portfolio of preclinical assets and the allosteric modulator drug discovery technology platform from Addex and accelerate their development. Addex Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of novel small molecule allosteric modulators for neurological disorders. Today the company announced that it will contribute a portfolio of preclinical neuroscience assets and its allosteric modulator small molecule discovery technology platform to the newly founded Neurosterix SA , which is like Addex based in Geneva. Addex will retain its partnerships with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Indivior PLC, as well as unpartnered clinical stage assets including dipraglurant for Parkinson’s disease and post-stroke/TBI recovery as well as its preclinical GABAB positive allosteric modulator (PAM) program for chronic cough. With initial funding of $63 million from Perceptive Xontogeny Venture Fund II, with participation from Perceptive Life Sciences Fund and Acorn Bioventures , Neurosterix will acquire the preclinical assets and the technology platform from Addex. In return, Addex will receive CHF5 million and a 20% equity interest in Neurosterix. To guide the launch of Neurosterix, Tim Dyer, in addition to his role at Addex, will assume the role of CEO of Neurosterix. Lénaïc Teyssédou, Head of Finance at Addex will join Addex Executive Management. As part of the transaction, Robert Lutjens and Jean-Philippe Rocher are stepping down from Addex Executive Management to focus on their new roles as Co-Heads of Discovery at Neurosterix. Mikhail Kalinichev, Head of Translational Science at Addex, will also join Neurosterix in a similar role and remain a member of the Executive Management of Addex. The Neurosterix R&D leadership team will continue to support Addex through a service arrangement between the two companies. “The launch of Neurosterix in partnership with Perceptive is an important validation of the Addex allosteric modulator drug discovery technology platform and provides the resources to accelerate development of important preclinical assets, including the M4 PAM and mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator (NAM) programs, into the clinic,” said Tim Dyer, CEO of Addex. “This transaction significantly reduces Addex operating costs and provides CHF5 million of cash thereby extending our cash runway beyond 2026. This allows us to reach important milestones from our partnered programs, including the Phase 2 epilepsy data from our Janssen partnership in the second quarter of 2024 as well as retaining an important upside in the future of Neurosterix through our 20% equity interest.” Allosteric modulators bind to their target receptor outside of the active site, where the natural ligand and traditional drugs operate. This non-competitive mode of action brings greater selectivity and more precision over the control of biological pathways, potentially delivering improved efficacy and safety. Addex pioneered the development of high-throughput industrial-scale discovery tools for allosteric modulator drug discovery, which have delivered a broad pipeline of oral small molecule drug candidates with the potential to transform the treatment of multiple neurological disorders. “The team at Addex has established a leading position in allosteric modulator drug discovery at an industrial scale. The assets generated have all been validated at a preclinical level and are ready to quickly move through final stages of preparation for clinical evaluation,” said Fred Callori, Managing Director, Venture at Perceptive Advisors and Chairman of the Board of Neurosterix. “We recognize the untapped value, not only of the assets now being developed within Neurosterix, but also the asset generating capacity of the allosteric modulator drug discovery technology platform, which with the necessary financial resources can potentially deliver transformational medicines and secure the long-term future of the company.” (Press release / SK)"

Several established companies among them Debiopharm recognize the transformative capability of the solution. Developing new therapies typically requires an average of ten years and costs up to two billion dollars for companies. The most time-consuming and costly aspect of this process is the clinical trials, which are mandatory for validating new treatments before commercialization. These trials are complex, often resulting in significant delays or failures that impact both the cost and availability of new treatments for patients. Clinical trials rely on complex protocols developed by experts, which describe all practical modalities of conducting the trial. Developing a protocol demands an average of 15 months of intensive work, where errors can have disastrous consequences. To address these challenges, Risklick has developed Protocol AI , which reduces development time and costs by up to 35%. Protocol AI optimizes protocol development by leveraging data-driven insights from a comprehensive dataset of global historical trial data. This method not only reduces both time and costs but also ensures consistency across trials. By using Protocol AI, experts can reduce protocol development time, make evidence-based decisions, and minimize the likelihood of amendments. The process involves three steps: exploring historical trial data, selecting key parameters based on evidence, and efficiently developing tailored protocols with generative AI. This approach accelerates innovation and the delivery of new treatments to patients, paving the way for medical advancement. Risklick has partnered with leading biotechnology and medical device companies, including Debiopharm and ISS AG. Debiopharm has invested in the Bern-based startup via its Innovation Fund . “This investment in Risklick is part of our strategy to equip our collaborators in the R&D, Clinical Operations, Regulatory Affairs departments with a collaborative tool designed to enhance their workflows, facilitate trial design and support regulatory compliance.

We are optimistic about our future and will be embracing all opportunities and challenges that are ahead of us and would like to thank our stakeholders for their continued trust in our exciting business.” Dr. Alexander Bausch, CEO and Member of the Board of Directors Kinarus Therapeutics Holding AG in Liquidation added: “I am particularly relieved that our attempts to save parts of the value of the KIN001 product and pay-off some of the outstanding liabilities resulting from the bankruptcy filings of Kinarus Holding and Kinarus AG we were forced to do in Q4 2023 may now materialize. I am also pleased that the incumbent Kinarus Holding shareholders may conserve a part of the value of their holdings and have the opportunity to participate in a larger company with a broader, more risk-balanced investment case. This arguably complex transaction represents a groundbreaking innovation and novelty, and I would like to particularly devote my thanks to YUMA Capital who have developed, negotiated, managed and will continue to manage this transaction with a large number of involved parties in a very professional, knowledgeable and diligent way.” (Press release / SK)"

This significant financial injection will accelerate both the development of their yeast cream in collaboration with the food industry and preparation for the market launch in 2025. The market for dairy alternatives is expanding worldwide, valued at $12 billion in 2023 and projected to reach $34 billion by 2033. These alternatives increasingly appeal to health- and environmentally-conscious consumers, although two-thirds of these consumers cite texture and the desire for a clean label as obstacles to consumption. Cultivated Biosciences offers a sustainable and healthy solution with its yeast-derived cream, a critical ingredient for mimicking the creaminess, functionality, and color of traditional dairy cream. This ingredient improves the texture and stability of dairy-free products, replaces additives, and doesn’t affect taste. The yeast cream is a natural emulsion, just as dairy cream is a natural emulsion, but derived from a specific type of oleaginous yeast. Cultivated Biosciences has developed unique and proprietary technologies, and the yeast cream is patented. The production process involves yeast biomass fermentation, a method distinct from precision fermentation as it is non-GMO, cheaper and more easily scalable. The yeast cream contains fats, proteins, and fibers, all from the yeast, featuring a microstructure of yeast lipid droplets that resemble milk fat droplets. This ingredient is designed for integration into final consumer products, with Cultivated Biosciences planning to supply it to the food industry and gastronomy sectors through a B2B model. The company has already validated its application in products like coffee creamers, milk, and ice cream with its clients and is exploring further uses. Swiss and international investors The funding round drew a strategic group of investors, highlighting widespread support for Cultivated Biosciences' mission to narrow the gap between dairy alternatives and traditional dairy with its fermentation-derived creamy ingredient. Navus Ventures , a Dutch venture capital firm dedicated to promoting sustainable food and energy systems, led the investment round. Founderful (previously known as Wingman Ventures), an early investor in Cultivated Biosciences, demonstrated their continued trust in the company by significantly contributing in this round, along with other early investors like HackCapital and Lukas Böni, founder of Planted. The round also introduced new investors, including US-based Joyful VC , Mandi Ventures , and Zürcher Kantonalbank , all persuaded by the company's significant progress since its $1.5 million pre-seed round in September 2022. Reflecting on the successful funding round, Cultivated Biosciences' CEO Tomas Turner stated, ""This funding validates our innovative approach and enables us to introduce our revolutionary yeast cream to the market. We aim to make alternative dairy products appealing to traditional dairy consumers, not just to reduce CO2 emissions from dairy production but also to tap into a multi-billion dollar market opportunity."" Eduard Meijer, Managing Director of Navus Ventures, added: “This dairy-free cream with great taste, mouthfeel, versatility, and functionality can significantly improve alternative dairy, with a technology that has the potential to scale economically. We are excited to team up to help them make these products commonplace, catering to diverse consumer preferences”. The 15-member team is now focused on scaling up production and collaborating closely with the food industry and gastronomy to introduce their ingredient to consumer markets by 2025.

S3398,Founderful,1.8,,,https://www.startupticker.ch/en/news/a-strong-start-for-axmed,0.0,0.0,2024-05-10,VC,Seed,BS,Axmed AG,Male,"Backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Axmed has secured additional $2 million to transform access to critical medicines in low- and middle-income countries. Its two-sided B2B marketplace bridges the gap between pharmaceutical manufacturers/suppliers and healthcare providers, ensuring a steady, affordable supply of critical medicines. The capital will fuel further development, leading to the launch in selected markets in Africa and the Caribbean. Despite representing over 80% of the world's population, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) account for a mere 6% of global pharmaceutical revenue, yet they represent a burgeoning $140 billion sector, with Africa alone accounting for over $43 billion in pharmaceutical opportunity. One of the primary factors contributing to this disparity is that buyers in these regions typically place orders of smaller quantities, which are less appealing to manufacturers. Ambitioned to tackle this challenge, Emmanuel Akpakwu, former Chief Commercial Officer for Novartis AG's Sub-Saharan Africa operations, was joined by Felix Ohnmacht and Sofia Radley-Searle, who have held key positions at Novartis and GSK. Leveraging over 30 years of collective experience in healthcare, finance, and public-private partnerships, they established Axmed during their studies at Havard, to provide a B2B marketplace platform that allows for equitable access to high quality medications in emerging and growth markets. The startup achieves this by optimizing the procurement process for healthcare providers, catering to public, third sector, and private entities. The platform aggregates demand for both off-patent and patented medicines, creating larger, more cost-effective order volumes for manufacturers while simultaneously enhancing buyer leverage on cost and availability. The platform further streamlines the process by curating and consolidating Requests for Proposals and efficiently mapping out supply logistics. This approach creates a win-win outcome: it lowers the barriers to accessing costly medicines for patients and providers, while enabling manufacturers to expand their footprint in underserved markets. Seed funding to accelerate time-to-market The closing of a $2 million seed funding round led by Founderful complements an earlier $5 million in grant funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , bringing total funds raised to $7 million. The investment propels Axmed into its next phase of strategic expansion, driving significant advancements in building out the engineering and business development teams, whilst preparing the platform for launch. Through targeted deployment of funds, Axmed will enhance its marketplace technology and forge alliances with key healthcare stakeholders to ensure a reliable supply of critical medicines. Currently, the startup has garnered the attention of around 20 suppliers and 20 pharma manufacturers. While preparing for its market launch, Axmed is also in the process of transferring it headquarters to Basel, Switzerland, where CEO Emmanuel Akpakwu and CCO Felix Ohnmacht are currently based. The Boston office that was established in 2023 will become the company’s subsidiary. Alongside the core team of four, Axmed has a total of 16 employees based in different countries, including Kenya, Egypt and others. (Press release/RAN)"

The Lausanne-based startup received CHF 150,000 from Venture Kick to drive forward the commercialization of its precision oncology platform against tumors in women. The poor efficacy of cancer drugs in female patients is the cause of one in six cancer deaths in women. This is mainly due to the fact that the artificial models currently used to test the efficacy of cancer drugs cannot replicate the complexity of patient tumors. As a result, most cancer drugs are not approved due to lack of efficacy and their development is extremely costly. Even when they are approved, cancer drugs have a failure rate of over 95%. Calico Biosystems combines experimental and digital methods to directly assess the efficacy of treatments in patient tumors, overcoming current models that cannot adequately reflect the complexity of tumors. In addition, Calico Biosystems' digital strategy uses computational modeling to predict the most effective therapeutic combinations for clinical use, enabling pharmaceutical companies to develop more effective and affordable cancer treatments. The co-founders, CEO Marie-Agnès Doucey and CSO Riccardo Turrini, are former employees of the Université de Lausanne (Unil) and have more than 15 years of experience in systems immuno-oncology. Calico aims to lead the precision oncology market and capture 8% of an industry market expected to reach over USD 250 billion by 2030 for drugs in preclinical development and Phase I clinical trials. The team has now received the final funding of CHF 150,000 from venture kick and will use this seed funding for market entry, innovation and business growth through strategic partnerships. “This exceptional program helped us get the right mindset, kicked us out of our comfort zone, and challenged our vision, pushing us to focus on what matters to achieve a successful business strategy,” stated Riccardo Turrini.

The Company has progressed two therapeutic candidates into mid-stage clinical development. The financing will be used to accelerate development of the lead asset for the treatment of uveal melanoma (UM), a rare cancer of the eye with few available treatments. iOnctura , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company combating neglected and hard-to-treat cancers, today announces that it has closed an EUR80 million Series B financing. The funding round was led by new investor Syncona Limited with participation by the EIC Fund , the venture arm of the European Innovation Council (EIC), as well as existing investors M Ventures , Inkef Capital , VI Partners , Schroders Capital and 3B Future Health Fund . Lead asset roginolisib is the first allosteric modulator of PI3Kδ, with a unique chemical structure and binding mode. It is being developed for indications burdened by immune mediated resistance and a high expression of PI3Kδ in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Roginolisib has potential to become the first successful, clinically meaningful therapy to target the critical PI3Kδ cancer pathway. It has demonstrated an unprecedented and first-in-class clinical profile in solid and hematological malignancies, with over 48 patients treated to date. The financing will be used to accelerate development of roginolisib for the treatment of uveal melanoma (UM), a rare cancer of the eye with few available treatments. Eye melanoma is a rapidly growing market which is projected to be worth USD 9.56B by 2032. In a Phase Ib clinical trial, roginolisib demonstrated long-term safety and promising efficacy in UM with sustained clinical activity over many months. Full results will be announced in the coming months. The successful UM data reported so far, combined with a rich preclinical data package, supports the rationale to expand into other indications. iOnctura plans to commence trials in other cancer indications, including non-small cell lung cancer and primary myelofibrosis, later in 2024. iOnctura's second clinical asset, cambritaxestat, is the only autotaxin inhibitor in clinical development to treat cancer. It has excellent potency and specificity, and is being developed for highly fibrotic tumors that overexpress autotaxin. A Phase Ib study of cambritaxestat in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer is ongoing. Catherine Pickering , Chief Executive Officer, iOnctura, said: ""This financing is validation of iOnctura's approach to developing precision cancer treatments with maximum clinical impact. These therapies have the potential to significantly prolong the healthspan of patients suffering with neglected cancer types, such as uveal melanoma. We are pleased to welcome our new investors Syncona and the EIC Fund alongside our existing strong syndicate. Their experience will be invaluable as we look to advance our pipeline and take iOnctura to its next stage of growth."" Roel Bulthuis , Managing Partner and Head of Investments at Syncona and Board member of iOnctura, added: ""iOnctura represents a compelling opportunity to invest in line with our strategy and capital allocation focus in a clinical-stage company, and take a promising lead programme through to late-stage development. To date, no company has been able to successfully target this well-known cancer pathway with sufficient precision. By allosterically modulating PI3Kδ, iOnctura has achieved a new level of precision and could be the first company to develop a clinically meaningful medicine targeting this pathway. Its programmes have potential utility across a range of cancers, which we are supporting the company to unlock through a refined clinical strategy."" (Press release / SK)"

The company was able to raise a further CHF 10 million from new and existing investors in a recent financing round. This means that CE approval is financially secured and the next steps for US approval can be initiated. The Berlin Heals Holding AG has developed the C-MIC device, a life-saving treatment for patients with heart failure (DCM / dilated cardiomyopathy). The patented technology is easily implantable and has shown clear clinical improvements in patients with heart failure. With the help of a constant electrical microcurrent, the inflammatory parameters of the patient's heart tissue are sustainably improved and edema (excess water) is flushed out of the heart. To date, 35 C-MICs have been successfully implanted in a randomized study. The excellent data from a previous pilot study with 10 patients has now been confirmed. Berlin Heals Holding AG has been able to follow up with patients from the pilot study for 3 years. All patients are still in NYHA class 1, achieve around 400 meters in the 6-minute walk test (6MGT) and, most importantly, the patients report a very good sense of well-being. Accordingly, the company was able to raise a further CHF 10 million from new and existing investors in a recent financing round. In total, around CHF 40 million has been invested in the development of the technology, the C-MIC implant and market approval. With the recent funding round CE approval is financially secured and the next steps for US approval can be initiated. These funds will also be used to initiate the first studies in the USA. Berlin Heals Holding AG expects CE certification at the end of 2025 / early 2026. Marko Bagaric, Chief Executive Officer of Berlin Heals Holding AG comments: ""We are convinced that we have developed a product for the treatment of severe heart failure that will restore quality of life to many patients worldwide and significantly extend their life expectancy. I am convinced that C-MIC will set a new standard in the treatment of these patients in the future. After a short operation, an imperceptible, constant microcurrent flows, which ensures that patients feel very well again within a few weeks."" (Press release / SK)"

The Bellinzona-based startup has completed its €1 million seed round to advance microbial-derived assets . Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men and a major cause of cancer mortality. While PC initially responds to therapy, resistance, which is usually lethal, emerges in 10% of all diagnosed patients. Once diagnosed with resistance, the second line of therapy starts, but often patients will develop resistance and metastases. Identifying novel therapeutic strategies that prevent resistance in PC remains an urgent medical need. Founded in 2023 in Ticino, MicThera collaborates with the Institute of Oncology Research (IOR) in Bellinzona to develop bacterial-derived therapeutics to enhance PC therapies building on the oncology research by the three founders Andrea Alimonti , Nicolò Pernigoni , and Calcinotto Arianna . The company’s research reveals that PC treatment impacts gut microbiota negatively, while patients with good prognosis exhibit higher Prevotella spp. levels, emphasizing the critical link between patient survival and gut microbiota composition. Prevotella spp are a group of bacteria naturally found in the human gut microbiome and are known for degrading carbohydrates and fiber. MicThera is currently investigating bacterial effector molecules generated by Prevotella spp. In contrast to traditional probiotic approaches, the startup unleashes the full potential of bacteria through a deep understanding of their effector molecules' impact on the host. Last month, MicThera secured a €1 million funding round from Indaco Bio Fund, the biotech-focused fund of Indaco Venture Partners. The funds will enable the team to develop and advance microbial-derived assets from the hit-to-lead phase, specifically targeting cancer treatments. “We are selectively scouting qualified technology transfer projects as part of our investment strategy. In MicThera we have found a promising mix of scientific validation and therapeutic potential that has convinced us to support a talented team to start their entrepreneurial journey,” Davide Turco, Partner and Managing Director of Indaco Venture Partners.

The company offers scalable end-to-end solutions and digital twins for simulating waveform propagation in complex media, imaging, and full-waveform inversion. Utilizing cutting-edge research results, including innovations across all components, results are delivered faster, at lower costs, and with increased reliability. Mondaic has a broad user community in industry and academia. Its flagship software Salvus has been used in millions of simulations by clients on five different continents. Important tool for subsurface exploration Full waveform inversion is an integral part of the seismic processing value chain for subsurface exploration, characterization and monitoring due to its ability to estimate high-resolution subsurface property models in areas of complex geology with limited human user intervention. The technology is also expected to play a strategic role for characterization and monitoring of subsurface carbon storage sites and in site surveys for wind farms. Both companies are committed to collaborate on the development and use of full waveform inversion going forward. Mondaic will be furthering the application of the jointly developed codes for ultrasonic non-destructive testing, material characterization, medical imaging, and other non-subsurface applications. During 2024, Shearwater’s acoustic finite differences full waveform inversion will be gradually replaced by Mondaic’s elastic spectral elements code that can model subsurface wavefield and waveforms to the highest level of precision. “Due to its unlimited modelling capabilities, this technology offers a higher level of inversion precision than conventional approaches. It is not only computationally efficient but also scalable, catering to a wide range of needs and complexities,” explained Sergio Grion, Chief Geophysicist - Processing Technology of Shearwater.

The startup received a CHF 150,000 investment from Venture Kick after winning stage three. The limited clinical success of many protein-based therapies is often due to poor delivery systems. The injected molecule diffuses quickly away from the injection site, which represents a significant challenge, especially in regenerative medicine where local action is crucial for tissue regeneration and repair. Orio Therapeutics is proposing a new approach to allow precise control over medication delivery. By modifying therapeutic proteins to incorporate a built-in delivery system, the method ensures they remain at the targeted injection site. The first product is a cardioprotective drug for post-heart attack care which aims to prevent damage by controlling inflammation, improving survival and quality of life, and speeding up recovery. The myocardial infarction market currently exceeds USD 20 billion and is projected to grow over the next 10 years. The startup completed a CHF 500,000 pre-seed funding round between stages 2 and 3 of the Venture Kick process. The additional CHF 150,000 from Venture Kick will enable the startup to propel pre-clinical development, notably with a crucial efficacy study scheduled for late 2024. The team comprises EPFL alumni CEO Ziad Julier and CSO Mikaël Martino who developed the technology at Monash University's Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute and incorporated the company at the BioArk Technological Site in Monthey in early 2023. “Participating in Venture Kick has been instrumental in our development. The program has accelerated the evolution of our vision to a sound business project, while also challenging us as entrepreneurs to step outside our comfort zone and acquire new skills”, said highlighted Ziad.

Winning CHF 150,000 investment from Venture Kick allows the startup to fast-track its development. Few aspects impact businesses more than regulation. However, monitoring and reporting on public affairs is a tedious and time-consuming task for companies. Two co-founders, Victor Kristof (CEO) and Jérémie Rappaz (CTO), founded and incorporated DemoSquare in 2023, emerging from the Information and Network Dyamics Lab (INDY) at the EPFL, with the aim of making political and regulatory data efficiently accessible to organizations that want to reduce regulatory uncertainty and discover new business opportunities. The Lausanne-based startup offers an AI-based platform, called Predikon to collect, monitor, analyze, and report on legislative and political activities, allowing public affairs managers to save up to 16 hours a week. The platform gives direct access to 50 years of Swiss legislative data, including profiles of current parliamentarians, their voting records, affairs they have submitted, and interest group connections. Using their research-backed AI algorithms, the platform can predict the adoption of new laws, the outcome of parliamentary votes, monitor regulatory topics across data sources and jurisdictions, and provide data-driven insights to help companies make strategic decisions. The platform also allows users to filter information by topic, such as important votes like the CO2 law. Demosquare stands out by providing clear and relevant analyses, enabling its customers to navigate effectively through a complex and ever-changing legislative environment. Currently, predictions by Predikon are being used by Swiss media Le Temps and NZZ. Through this approach, the software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution addresses challenges in the CHF 10.8B global public affairs market. The CHF 150,000 from Venture Kick will contribute to DemoSquare’s expansion to European Union institutions and other European countries, thereby strengthening its international presence. “The Venture Kick support is a recognition of our work and our potential to transform the public affairs landscape.

OneRagtime, a French venture capital fund that led Hive’s Seed round, and a collection of private investors also joined the round. Since October 2023, Hive has amassed over 25,000 total active users and contributors from 147 countries. Hive is reinventing the cloud from a centralized model that uses expensive physical servers to a distributed cloud infrastructure that aggregates individual devices’ unused hard drive and computing capacities. Hive’s model helps businesses efficiently manage their cloud-related expenses, reduce dependency on a select few cloud providers, and significantly reduces cloud energy use. In 2023, global data centres, which power the world’s cloud, consumed 7.4 Gigawatts of power, a 55% increase from 2022. Currently, data centres account for up to 3% of global electricity consumption, with projections suggesting this could rise to 4% by 2030. “Hive is addressing the pressing need for a new cloud paradigm that democratizes access, lowers financial barriers, and encourages innovation,” said David Gurlé, Hive Founder. “With over 70% of the computing power available in our devices and billions of devices connected to the Internet, Hive’s community driven model builds 'The Right Cloud' to offer a greener, more resilient network and secure alternative that also promotes a more equitable cloud solution. We thank our investors, as well as INRIA and Bpifrance, for their continuous support as we look to achieve our ambitious goals.” Since October 2023, Hive has amassed over 25,000 total active users and contributors from 147 countries, who store their files on hiveDisk and contribute a portion of their unused hard drive to hiveNet to effectively lower their subscription costs and build the distributed cloud. The contributed computing capacity to hiveNet also powers hiveCompute, allowing companies to manage workloads, such as run GenAI inference, video processing, and 3D modelling. HiveNet’s architecture provides access to additional CPU, GPU, or NPU when needed, boosting the much-needed computing power. Companies seeking more control could also build their own private hiveNet, where IT managers retain full control over the devices. Hive is based in Geneva and has a distributed team with numerous members in France - including CEO Antoine Clerget. According to his LinkedIn profile, David Gurlé works out of Dubai. With its latest funding round, Hive’s sights are set on growing its team and global footprint, with a focus on addressing the enterprise markets starting with startups and SMBs. The team is prioritizing several areas of the business, including product development, building an engaged community of contributing Hivers, and sales and marketing efforts to reach users at scale. “We are big believers of Hive’s distributed cloud technology that will enable cheaper and more efficient access to computing power and storage, a critical point when most of our ventures may have an AI component requiring increasing such computing power,” said Alex Manson, who heads SC Ventures . “In addition to our investment, our ventures will be leveraging Hive’s services.” “Cloud technology has opened up horizons of innovation, but it also comes with challenges in terms of costs, security, data privacy, and environmental impact, heightened by the increasing demand for computing resources, especially for artificial intelligence,” said Stéphanie Hospital, Founder & CEO at OneRagtime . “Hive, with its pioneering approach to distributed cloud, makes cloud access more secure, affordable, and efficient for everyone, and enables the sharing of computational power resources.” (Press release / ES) Picture L-R: David Gurlé, Hive Founder, and Alex Manson (SC Ventures)"

The funds will enable the St. Gallen-based company to scale its high-resolution weather and climate technology and expand into new markets and industries. More than 450 companies, including CVS Health, Tesla, Swiss Re, Airbus, Toyota, Volkswagen and EDF Energy, rely on Meteomatics for weather data that can significantly impact everything from energy savings, logistics and process automation to risk management and product design. With its revolutionary weather forecasting approach, Metomatics is the only company that runs a weather model with a resolution of 1 km, or down to street level, updating every hour with the latest weather data and observations. Visibility at this level allows the company to identify even the smallest meteorological phenomena such as thunder, hail, wind and other storms. This is in contrast with current government and commercial weather observation technology that run at resolutions of 10-50 km and are updated only 3-4 times a day, lacking the data to effectively detect and forecast weather events in low-level airspace. To provide weather forecasting in the mid and lower atmosphere at this degree of precision, Meteomatics collects weather data using its Meteodrones, weather drones capable of flying up to 6 km (20 '000 feet). By combining its high-resolution weather models with data collected by its Meteodrones and 110 other sources, the company delivers businesses unparalleled accuracy for hyperlocal weather impacts. Meteomatics’ new investor, Lockheed Martin Ventures , makes strategic investments in companies that are developing cutting-edge technologies in core businesses and new markets important to Lockheed Martin. The funds enable Meteomatics to bring its services to industries including energy, aviation, insurance, defence, and governments and enter new markets. “Meteomatics’ weather intelligence has the potential to give the U.S. and its allies a better understanding of the dynamic environments in which assets and personnel operate, both improving operational effectiveness and reducing risk”, said Chris Moran, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Ventures. Currently, Meteomatics is based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, with local operations in Germany, Spain, the UK and, most recently, the U.S. The company launched operations in the U.S. in 2023 with the country’s first Meteodrone at GrandSky Aviation Park’s Weather Operations Center.

The myFlow method offers an alternative and more reliable neurofeedback modality in combination with a wearable, easy-to-use VR headset with eye-tracking capabilities. As such, myFlow is scalable and easily available to large groups of users. Lara Ming explained the company’s motivations for targeting sports & well-being, “Our research shows that the sports sector has one of the greatest demands and the fastest adoption of our new method. This will enable us to have faster development cycles and helps with a rapid market launch. Moreover, existing sports applications have shown that fitness tools used by professional athletes are also often adopted by the general public, thus failing to address the core needs of athletes.” The startup is currently testing the Alpha version of its solution, a large pilot project with the Swiss Federal Institute of Sports in Magglingen to develop sports-specific mental training exercises to refine the product for the sports market.

The scale-up startup is developing long-range uncrewed helicopter systems for inspection, surveillance and public safety applications. Designed to replace crewed helicopters, SwissDrones provides a safe and cost-effective aerial intelligence solution for a wide range of applications, including infrastructure inspection, surveillance and public safety missions beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). SwissDrones aircraft emit up to 95 percent fewer CO2 emissions than crewed helicopters at significantly reduced operating costs and without putting flight crews at risk. The systems allow for the integration of high-end sensor payloads of up to 40 kg (88 lbs) and enable long-range missions day and night with a flight endurance of multiple hours. SwissDrones’ aircraft are currently operating across Asia, Europe, and North America. To support its further growth and expansion, existing investors joined new investor  DiamondStream Partners in the company’s latest financing round, which raised a 7-digit figure.  “We see SwissDrones as leaders in bringing next-generation aviation technology to critical use cases in infrastructure inspection, aerial surveillance and public safety,” said David Spurlock, Managing Director of DiamondStream Partners. “The combination of the payload/range of the aircraft, a focus on customer service needs, and a platform that will enable high levels of asset utilization are set to bring disruptive economics to catalyze growth in these market segments. We are excited to support the company as it grows as a leader in this space and brings tremendous value across the sector. “We are very happy to have DiamondStream Partners as a new investor,” said Ulrich Amberg, CEO of SwissDrones. “Our team looks forward to leveraging their vast entrepreneurial and operational experience in the aviation and aerospace industries as we strive to transform the way aerial intelligence is gathered in crucial applications worldwide.” To expand its capabilities and meet customer demand, SwissDrones collaborates with civil aviation authorities worldwide to secure regulatory approvals and flight authorizations, allowing for enhanced mission-specific operations. The company is among the first organizations that have obtained a European drone operator license, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Light UAS Operator Certificate (LUC). The certificate allows SwissDrones to self-authorize flight operations of its aircraft across EASA countries, including BVLOS operations, within the limits of the certificate. It is the highest authorization achievable under current European drone regulations. The SwissDrones SDO 50 uncrewed helicopter platform has also received a Special Airworthiness Certificate (SAC-EC) from the FAA in the US.

The funding will enable Sparta to expand its offering and grow its global presence. Sparta is a live market intelligence and forecasting platform that gives traders, refiners, banks, hedge funds and wholesalers access to live leading indicators that have a direct impact on trading decisions. While most data platforms in the space focus on past trends and data, Sparta is unique in the market as the only platform that concentrates exclusively on delivering prices and opportunities that can still be traded and captured. Sparta was founded in 2020 by two former traders, Miles Moseley and Felipe Elink Schuurman, to answer a common problem shared by most traders: 90% of pricing data required to make trading decisions is kept in silos and shared manually by voice, email, or chat. This information is then manually processed into trading insights through Excel spreadsheets and there is a lack of centralised databases to allow analysis of historical price movements and trends. Consequently, traders do not have all of the information that they need, when they need it, to make fully informed decisions in a fast-moving market. Sparta’s technology provides market intelligence, pricing and forecasting data in real-time. The company already works with clients globally, including Philips 66, Chevron, Trafigura, Equinor and more. The investment will allow the Geneva-based company to expand its offering beyond the platform, with plans ranging from developing premium insight, expanding to new commodity verticals, implementing full customisation processes, optimising workflow processes and developing AI tools with the aim to provide forward-looking actionable insights and predictions. The raise will also support globalisation plans. Currently located in Geneva, London, Houston, Singapore and Madrid, Sparta plans to expand within these existing territories, as well as establishing a foothold in new regions.

The startup has raised $14M in Seed funding led by Intel Capital to accelerate the time to market. Particle contamination during the manufacturing of semiconductor chips is leading to losses worth billions of dollars, while also contributing to the industry’s environmental footprint. Unfortunately, to date, finding the source of such contaminants is both costly and time-consuming. UNISERS developed a particle monitoring platform that uses surface-enhanced Raman scattering to identify the source of contamination, facilitating stronger product yield and lower carbon footprint at chip manufacturing plants. Unlike other solutions, UNISERS can monitor the defectivity of individual process chemicals by detecting the size, concentration and composition of particles with cutting-edge sensitivity and molecular specificity. The proceeds from the seed round will enable Unisers to accelerate the delivery of its commercial products to leading semiconductor partners by 2023. In addition, the company will be able to demonstrate the value of the technology in a number of further critical use cases. Intel Capital led the round, with participation from M Ventures , RSBG Ventures and Swisscom Ventures . “As the semiconductor industry continues to suffer from the chip shortage crisis, the pressure is on to drastically reduce the contamination of chips which compromise output,” Jennifer Ard, Managing Director and Head of Investment Operations at Intel Capital said. “UNISERS is drastically reducing the time it takes to find the source of contamination by detecting particles that were previously undetectable, unlocking new opportunities to conserve our chip supply through better contamination identification capabilities.” “We are very excited to have closed this Seed Round with several strong investors who share our belief that our unique technology will become a must-have solution for contamination control all along the semiconductor manufacturing value chain,” said Ali Altun, CEO and founder of UNISERS.  “Each investor will support us strongly on individual domains and hence help us on our journey to become a critical player for the whole semiconductor manufacturing world”, noted the Unisers in its LinkedIn post. UNISERS was founded on 11 April 2019 as a spin-off of ETH Zurich. Before the foundation of the company, Dr. Altun received the Pioneer Fellowship Grant from ETH Foundation which includes a special entrepreneurship education program organized by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lab of ETH Zurich. During its early stages, the company received awards, grants, and business coaching support from Gebert Ruef Foundation, Venture Kick (First round), Climate KIC, and the Innosuisse Core Coaching Program.

An undisclosed international market leader headquartered in Switzerland led the round. Founded in 2022 as a spinoff from the ETH after years of research, Zurich Soft Robotics is developing Solskin, the world’s first moving multi-functional photovoltaic facade system that provides adaptive shading, thanks to novel soft-material pneumatic actuators. The movable solar modules, mounted on a lightweight structure attached to the facade of a building, automatically follow the sun’s trajectory during the day, thus maximizing the electrical PV output. The modules can also provide shade inside the building during hot days. Thanks to Solskin AI, an intelligent control system, the facade can adapt to the environment, using data such as weather forecasts and users’ needs to optimize for cost savings and occupants‘ comfort. With the combination of shading and PV, Solskin produces up to 40% more electricity and saves up to 80% of a building’s cooling demand compared to conventional systems. In the current energy crisis, building owners seek ways to reduce operational costs and integrate PV in an architecturally pleasing way, for which Solskin is a perfect solution. Following the success of pilot projects at HiLo, Zurich Soft Robotics has secured fresh capital to grow the team to accelerate the development of Solskin, and make the system commercially ready starting Q3 2023. A 1300 m2 Solskin facade system will be installed on a new production building of Keller Druckmesstechnik AG in Winterthur in 2025. According to the startup, Solskin presents a major step towards realizing its vision of establishing Solskin as an elegant solution for the building energy transition. “This investment is a testimony to the hard work of our team and the potential of our innovative product to disrupt the BIPV market”, said Bratislav Svetozarevic, CEO of Zurich Soft Robotics.

The startup has closed its first funding round with Swiss and Italian industry partners to accelerate the scale-up of its product and prepare for market entry in Switzerland. Driven by the need to improve environmental sustainability, health, and animal welfare, consumers worldwide are on the hunt for vegan meat substitutes. Several industry reports predict that the global market for meat alternatives will experience strong growth in the coming years and reach a multi-billion dollar value by 2030. Despite the momentum in the category, current plant-based meat analogues still struggle to attract and maintain consumers. Products that strive to imitate conventional meat frequently contain artificial flavors and a long list of ingredients yet fail to achieve a natural mouthfeel and texture. The sustainability credentials of many plant-based meats have also come under scrutiny due to long supply and distribution chains. Founded in 2021 in Küsnacht (Zurich), Yumame Foods is on a mission to develop healthy, tasty and sustainable foods that fundamentally overcome these limitations. The company blends fungi and fermentation to create vegan alternatives to meat: instead of aiming to simulate animal products, Yumame’s products have their own unique taste and texture, and undergo minimal processing. They are easily cooked with a variety of methods and can be produced in any location using local ingredients. This innovative approach lies in both the product formulation and the production process. The proprietary formulations have been developed in collaboration with chefs and fermentation specialists. The poduct assortment is currently in final development and in industrialization. ""We plan to enter the Swiss market in a few months from now through selected restaurants and shops. This will enable to further optimize the products before their scale up to possible serve retailer chains in the near future, first in Switzerland and then in further countries,"" said Eliane Zamprogna, Founder and CEO of Yumame. The new investment round was supported by Italian food company Molino Quaglia S.p.A. and Swiss company Juna Holding AG. The funds will accelerate the industrialization of Yumame’s consumer products ahead of their launch on the Swiss market. Founder and CEO Eliana Zamprogna Rosenfeld says a large proportion of the money will go towards further optimizing the production capacity, as well as the product’s shelf life and nutrient profile. Yumame will also develop further recipes to expand its range. This will happen alongside investment in the communication of the concept and brand, and consumer testing of the product ahead of launch.  The company has previously received financial support from Innosuisse and the startup program VentureKick. ""We are thrilled to have closed this investment round with the support of leading investors, who have profound knowledge of the food industry and business development,"" said Eliana Zamprogna. ""This achievement is a sign of confidence in our approach. The funds will enable us to better address consumers' need for tasty, simple and local foods that are nutritious and convenient to use in place of meat."" ""We are really pleased to support Yumame Foods in this important step into the domestic market and to prove that food can be made fundamentally more sustainable by using local resources and efficient production methods,"" said Philipp Balmer, CEO of Juna Holding AG. “It is also a key milestone in terms of the future internationalization of the products and extension into other food categories,” added Lucio Quaglia, CEO of Molino Quaglia S.p.A.

The startup has secured $5.5m in a seed funding round to pilot and expand production capacities. With their participation, Amadeus APEX Technology Fund has made its first investment in Switzerland. The oversubscribed funding round saw participation from a venture capital consortium including the Amadeus APEX Technology Fund , Wingman Ventures , Ciech Ventures and Zürcher Kantonalbank . The funds will allow Unisieve to accelerate its development while expanding its production capacity. Wolfgang Neubert, General Partner at the Amadeus APEX Technology Fund, commented: “UniSieve is our first industrial technology investment in Switzerland. We were impressed by the team’s ability to bring their academic thesis to life and make it commercially viable and scalable. It has the potential to be hugely impactful for the world. We look forward to supporting the team on their journey.” Founded in 2018, UniSieve is dedicated to solving the heavy industries’ energy drain challenge to help them get closer to Net-Zero goals. Today, 10-15% of the world’s energy consumption accounts for separation and purification, a key process step for most industries. Heavy industries have still failed to create energy efficiencies in their legacy, highly energy-intensive assets that are worth billions of dollars. For example, in chemical plants, a major energy drain is the chain of separation and purification steps because this still depends on energy-intensive thermal processes. The Zurich-based startup developed membranes-based separation solutions that can separate chemicals, energy carriers, or CO2 from flue gas based on size exclusion, without heat or cold. The solution bypasses the need for heating or cooling through sieving membranes that can reduce the energy needed for separating and purifying molecules by up to 90%. “Our solution is addressing a major emissions cause and its potential for energy and emission reduction is significant for our planet”, says Samuel Hess, CEO and co-founder of Unisieve. “In essence, we say stop boiling and start sieving to end energy-intensive distillation. The concept of sieving works as simple as a coffee filter holding back the coffee powder from an espresso. However, it gets a little tricky when separating chemicals that vary in size by a fraction of an angstrom only (1 angstrom equals one-tenth of a nanometer). To do so, the sieve must be extremely narrow and precise. The UniSieve membrane is a structure made of a highly ordered network of porous crystals that generate in a repeating pattern, much like ancient Roman mosaics,” explains Samuel. The company has completed pilot testing with industry leaders, demonstrating that the separation solution works. With a solution ready to be deployed, the startup has signed several contracts with others under negotiation to pilot the membranes in a variety of applications. To this end, Uniseive has obtained Pre-seed funding from Wingman Ventures and several prestigious grants from the European Union, the Swiss government, and private foundations enabling them to prove the hypothesis of their scalable and affordable high-performing membranes.

Participants in the round include Austrian sustainable travel marketplace, ASI Reisen , and several prominent angels, such as ex-Uber and founder of Ambo Ventures and Kenyan-based lodge Emboo Camp , Loic Amado . So far, Viatu has raised $1.2M. The funds will enable Viatu to finish building its direct booking system and launch the interface to its customers, while continuously improving the functionality of its product based on customer experience. On average, people spend up to 10 hours , spread across two-to-three weeks, planning a holiday, jumping between almost 38 different sites before finalizing and booking their plans. To ease the process, some people opt for booking a complex multi-day tour through travel agents - 80% of trips to Africa are booked through travel agencies, with only 1-in-5 choosing to book directly. The process can still be slow and expensive. Founded in 2020 by travel industry professionals Alfredo Seidemann (CEO), Johan Bodenstein (CTO) and Bárbara Buchel (Chief Impact Officer), Viatu makes responsible and sustainable travel easier to access by offering a data-driven, a fully customizable trip builder with live pricing and availability, courtesy of API plug-ins, giving travellers control and ownership of their adventures. Viatu is the first travel-focused self-service website that enables people to book a ‘connected trip’, where they can seamlessly organize every aspect of their itinerary – from accommodation to experiences and car rental – through a single platform. Viatu’s trip builder can cut the searching and booking process from weeks to minutes and give travellers full control of their itineraries, all through one platform. Viatu focuses on holidays to destinations that are logistically challenging to visit due to the lack of available information and knowledge of where to go, how to book, and the best way to travel between multiple and unfamiliar locations in-country. The startup specialises in multi-day trips to sub-Saharan Africa such as Botswana, Namibia, Rwanda, and South Africa. “We created Viatu to take the guesswork and extensive manual labour out of booking sustainable travel and empower travellers to become an active force in enriching local environments, economies, and communities. The additional funding will allow us to further develop our platform to make arranging an adventure holiday from your smartphone as easy as booking a taxi or ordering a takeaway” said Bárbara Buchel, Co-founder and Chief Impact Officer at Viatu.

The newly closed round will enable the Zurich-based startup to strengthen its team and speed up expansion activities. Thanks to the unique patented technology, know-how in indoor drone flight and workflow automation, ETH spin-off Tinamu Labs provides a flexible solution for automated inventory monitoring for bulk cargo. The service is used by global companies in mining, commodity trading, and the construction industry, which still mainly measure stockpile volumes manually and report on paper and Excel. This manual task is not only slow, expensive and time-consuming, but it also leads to errors and low accuracy. The startup launched in 2022 and has since exported it from Switzerland to Belgium and France. As of this year, the startup is expanding its activities in other locations to deliver a solution addressing current supply chain and operations challenges. A recent technology partnership with commercial drone manufacturer Parrot allows Tinamu to progressively upgrade its clients to the new ANAFI Ai drone from Parrot. This will enable the startup to provide a full turnkey solution comprising hardware and software. Customers, including Kibag ( see video ), a leading Swiss company in the building materials and construction sector employing 2000 people in 14 gravel plants, 3 quarries and 25 concrete plants, have benefited from automated workflow to deliver fast, accurate, and cost-efficient periodic volume measurements of stockpiles. No piloting skills or GPS are required. The startup also plans to install its solution in multiple locations of the supply chain company Trafigura, as revealed to Startupticker. “Tinamu's trial installations in 2022 have successfully transitioned into permanent contracts. As our clients have a widespread presence, we are now expanding our services to their other locations. Simultaneously, we are establishing relationships with new clients in Europe, marking our entry into the market,” said Denis Libouton, Commercial Lead at Tinamu. In light of its recent activities, the company has secured fresh capital in a pre-series A financing round of CHF 1 million to speed up growth and development. Led by Alpana Ventures and DAA Capital Partners , the round attracted new investors from the drone and trading industries and existing investors. The funds will be used to support the fast onboarding of several upcoming installations for both existing and new clients and to support sales activities. As a result, Tinamu plans to expand its team by hiring more professionals in the coming months. Ready for a Series A “This is an exciting moment for our team. We are seeing an increasing number of clients benefiting from our services, which validates the innovative technology we have developed. Considering the significant potential for geographical and industrial expansion, we are planning a Series A funding round to support our upcoming global growth, said Tobias Nägeli, CEO of Tinamu.

Founded in 2015 as a spinoff from the Institute for Biomechanics at ETH Zurich, ZuriMED develops smart solutions for novel treatments in sports medicine. One of its products is the Surgical-Fiberlock Technology, a novel approach for soft tissue repair designed to allow the surgeon to attach patches and sutures more easily and reliably. Applicable in orthopaedics, the technology has also shown huge potential for other indications, such as minimal invasive cardiovascular surgery. With the newly closed funding round, ZuriMED will accelerate the development and market uptake of the Surgical-Fiberlock Technology. The secured financing will facilitate regulatory registration of the first product based on this technology that targets shoulder rotator cuff repair. ZuriMED aims to broadly leverage its groundbreaking technology to address the growing surgical device market in both the United States and Europe within the next three years. Furthermore, with support from the recently introduced Innosuisse Swiss Accelerator Grant program, ZuriMED will receive an additional CHF 2.4 million (USD 2.7 million) of non-diluting funding. This financial boost will expedite product development and regulatory registration of a second Surgical-Fiberlock device aimed at minimally invasive surgical repair of herniated lumbar discs, also a major unmet clinical need in orthopedic medicine. Chindex Medical Limited (Hong Kong), a member of the Fosun MedTech enterprise, led the round with support from Yellowstone Holding AG (Geneva) and a group of private investors that includes leading orthopaedic surgeons from Switzerland, Germany, France, and the United States. “The Surgical-Fiberlock technology is a breakthrough innovation in tendon augmentation and closure that offers benefits for both the surgeon and the patient.

High costs in Switzerland have also led the company to increase production capacity in Turkey and Asia where demand is growing and opening new business perspectives. To meet growing demand in a challenging economical context, Tyre Recycling Solutions ( TRS ) recently closed a preliminary round of 4 million Swiss francs out of a Series D financing round of 8.5 million Swiss francs. Contacted by Startupticker.ch, Staffan Ahlgren, CEO and founder of TRS, indicates that this figure could be adapted to the demand from potential investors and strategic decisions to take participations in the recycling partners factories. His company will announce the final amount invested at the end of September. High costs in Switzerland prompted this year the Vaud based company to increase its production capacity to its partner in Turkey, to Spain and new identified potential partners in Europe. The aim was clear: to remain competitive and be able to seize growth opportunities in the Middle East and Asian markets. Speaking of demand, Staffan Ahlgren believes that the industry is finally discovering the possibilities offered by his company's new TyreXol rubber powders, and the economic virtues of using recycled materials. Currently, TRS solutions are used mainly in three areas: tires, asphalt and footwear, a market showing great potential. In this regard, the CEO mentions the promising collaboration started with a global player that develops and manufactures advanced materials and component solutions for footwear. New business perspectives in Asia This week LD Carbon , an environmentally-friendly waste treatment and raw materials recycling company in South Korea that has developed a proprietary pyrolysis technology, and TRS signed a memorandum of understanding to set up an initial plant for the production of TRS's TyreXol rubber powders from the TRS Water Pulse process. The remaining end-of-life tires after TyreXol production will be used by LDC to produce tire pyrolysis oil (""TPO"") and high-quality reclaimed carbon black (""rCB""), the quality of which has already passed the assurance tests of various global tire manufacturers for commercial uses. This partnership with LDC opens up a lot of opportunities for TRS. The Vaud based company has several major customers producing in Asia. “They have been requesting TRS to produce in the region. Circular economy means also shorter supply chain. It took us many years to identify the right partner and right location in Asia. We are very excited to partner with LDC, they are a highly competent and driven team.” explains Sonia Megert, TRS Chief Operating Officer. Furthermore, LDC and TRS share a list of prospective customers in Japan and Korea for their respective products. TRS produces a highly reactive rubber powder (TyreXol), LDC produces recycled carbon black. Both are in demand from major tire manufacturers who needs to reach their publicly declared sustainability targets. Thus TRS expects that this step will accelerate the approval process at those large customers. Producing currently 11’000 tons of TyreXol powder per year, TRS expects to multiply the number by 6 in the next two to three years.

They raised between CHF 200,000 and CHF 1 million via their own platform, conda and Seedrs. On another note, Funders, the crowdfunding platform launched by the Lucerne Cantonal Bank announced, that it will cease operations at the end of the year. Existing and new investors (110 in total) have contributed CHF 1 million to swisspeer ’s crowdinvesting campaign. An important part of the investors are also active on the platform as financiers. Swisspeers is an independent online platform that allows companies to obtain loans directly from investors - without the intermediation of a financial institution. For investors, swisspeers offers the opportunity to make interesting direct investments in small and medium-sized enterprises. Since its establishment in 2016, the platform has brokered over CHF 140 million in loans to 650 companies. Based on this development, the startup aims to reach break-even by 2025 and to become more attractive for institutional investors by strengthening its balance sheet. In this coming phase, therefore, the company’s efforts will be steered towards further growth, strengthening its market position with additional capital placements (debt and equity) and expanding the cooperation with Basellandschaftliche Kantonalbank which was established a year ago. More information can be found in a blog post on the swisspeers website. Tera Technologies reaches 121% target on Seedrs Established in 2020, Tera Technologies is on a mission to disrupt the electric vehicle market with its flagship product, the MiracleONE, a revolutionary vehicle equipped with a proprietary range extender technology. This implies that the car can have four batteries, providing an extra 80 KM on the journey. The vehicle’s batteries can be charged and swapped at any location, even a home, creating a flexible and user-friendly approach to electric vehicle charging. To this end, the startup has built two drivable prototypes: the first one in Q4 2022 and the second one early this year. The startup’s business model focuses on sales and rentals of its innovative products and services, thus far, it has secured over €100,000 in revenue during a two-week campaign in March 2023, demonstrating market interest. The recent crowdfunding campaign, which sought to raise £200’000, also stirred up public interest. At the closing, the startup had received £243,280 from 302 investors. The funds will be used to cover production costs for the 55 limited edition MiracleONE vehicles, marketing activities aiming to increase the visibility of TERA's products, broaden the customer base, and drive sales. About 40% of the proceeds will flow into  the pre-production development of the upcoming MiracleTWO model, which is anticipated to be launched in 2024. Smartpurse | +200k via Conda A total of 44 investors, with a large proportion being female investors, participated in SmartPurse ’s crowdfunding campaign on Conda. With more than CHF 212,600 raised, the campaign was 373% financed. SmartPurse is now financially equipped to further pursue its goal of making independent financial knowledge accessible to everyone, especially women. The startup developed a platform through its web and app platform. The investment will allow the Zurich-based startup to expand its offering and bring its services to even more people. Funders shuts down There are around 30 platforms for the various forms of crowdfunding in Switzerland. On the one hand, new platforms are constantly being added, others are being discontinued.

Since launching in 2022, the startup has won notable customers including PwC, and several Fortune 500 and State-Owned Enterprises. The proceeds from the seed round will propel its development and expansion. Building and deploying vision-based enterprise applications is complex and expensive. Advances across AI, GPU hardware, and deep learning have made computer vision far more accessible as algorithms become easier to train. But without the requisite technical expertise, many of these models struggle to reach production. Deploying and scaling these models in the field also requires significant infrastructure, which is a major barrier to enterprise adoption despite heavy industry demand. While computer vision has existed for several years, implementation challenges have held back significant adoption. Viso offers a single workspace for businesses to develop, deploy, operate and scale computer vision applications. Using Viso Suite, the end-to-end enterprise vision platform, businesses can build and deploy better vision-based applications in days instead of months by abstracting and automating the entire lifecycle across data pipelining, configuration, deployment, serving and monitoring. Viso’s solution allows businesses to unify tools, models and data across the computer vision application lifecycle in one easy-to-use no-code interface without the need for significant technical expertise. The platform allows organizations to use any common camera and re-use existing cameras. It also supports the latest ML frameworks and computing hardware, making it possible for enterprises to deeply integrate existing systems across the organization. The modular and flexible architecture of Viso’s platform is highly customisable, enabling businesses to build applications according to their own unique needs. The self-serve platform gives users the ability to plug in their own best-in-class components (or use Viso’s pre-built modules), meaning businesses can train their own employees and build up their own internal capabilities using Viso’s platform. Founded by Gaudenz Boesch and Nico Klingler in 2018, Viso has been bootstrapped to date and has a globally distributed and remote-first team based in Switzerland and the US. Since launching the platform in the spring of 2022, the company has already achieved impressive momentum and its customers include PwC, A2A, DPD, alongside several other Fortune 500 and State-Owned Enterprises.

Both Netherlands-based investors recognize the transformative effect Vivent’s crop health solutions have in improving the profitability of growers and the sustainability of food production. Vivent pioneers unique AI-enabled technology that gives farmers and agtech businesses early warning of disease, pests, nutrient deficiencies, and water stress, using biological signals from the plants themselves. Vivent’s wearables for plants provide alerts long before visual symptoms appear so growers can treat plants earlier. Vivent’s product is the first commercial crop health diagnostic system based on plant electrophysiology –internal electrical signals plants use to coordinate growth, reproduction and defence. The technology leads to optimized growing recipes, increased yields, and improved crop protection effectiveness. It also encourages the adoption of environmentally preferable crop protection solutions – so more food with fewer inputs. “We are delighted to have Pymwymic and Horticoop join our ownership group, as we increase sales and refine product offerings to new agricultural sectors. They are both driven by deep connections with sustainable agriculture and their involvement reinforces the industry’s growing interest in plant centered cultivation”, comments Vivent co-founder and CEO, Carrol Plummer “Using recent advances in machine learning, we can now decipher the internal network in plants and learn exactly what they need ,” says Dr Nigel Wallbridge, Vivent co-founder. “With our new investors we can deliver plant-driven responsive sustainable agricultural systems of all kinds.” Vivent solutions are successfully deployed in greenhouses and indoor farms and are increasingly used for field-grown crops, like potatoes, apples, grapes, canola and sugar beet, meaning it can serve a wide range of growers and crops across Europe and North America.

Helping organizations to overcome this hurdle, Tune Insight closed a $3.4m funding round as it helps them automate collective intelligence extraction, reduce data liability, streamline compliance, while re-enforcing data security and privacy. The oversubscribed seed funding round was led by 14Peaks Capital with participation of US-based Inflection.xyz , Debiopharm and Zurich Cantonal Bank . Existing investors Wingman Ventures also participated in the funding round. Tune Insight was founded in 2021 by Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, Frederic Pont, Romain Bouyé and Jean-Pierre Hubaux. The startup is a confidential collaborative analytics and privacy-preserving machine learning solution. The genesis of Tune Insight lies in 2016, when Swiss hospitals came to the founders (then researchers) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) asking if the latest progress in applied cryptography could help solve a challenge they could not overcome, but paramount for personalized healthcare: hospitals wanted to collaborate with each other, but without transferring or revealing their patient data to others. Today, Tune Insight is deployed at University Hospital Zurich, CHUV in Lausanne, Inselspital in Bern, Switzerland, and powers applications such as survival analysis for precision oncology and personalized reference ranges. The latter application enables practitioners to rely on up-to-date reference ranges for their patients, based on collective data of 9 million data points from over 250,000 patients, instead of outdated ranges from a less relevant population. For University Spital Basel, Tune Insight enables the secure training of dermatology machine learning models on skin images across jurisdictions. Tune Insight solutions also bridge the trust gap between payers like Groupe Mutuel with care providers for value-based healthcare (VBHC), and pharmaceutical companies with hospitals for streamlined access to real-word evidence (RWE). In other domains, Tune Insight’s solutions are used by actuaries to facilitate collective risk computations for insurances and in financial services for collective fraud detection, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating financing of terrorism. In cybersecurity, Tune Insight works with managed security service providers (MSSPs) and Armassuisse, the procurement branch of the Swiss military, enabling collective cyber resilience to better defend against cyber-attacks. The confidential computing operations supported by the Tune Insight platform range from private set intersection to advanced data analytics to secure federated learning on structured data, including images, which play an increasing role in healthcare and for predictive maintenance. Tune Insight is also working at extending support for privacy-preserving generative AI. Starting from secure data collaborations and privacy-preserving federated learning, Tune Insight is accompanying its customers towards data and model valorization. Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, co-founder & CEO of Tune Insight, has been working on privacy-enhancing technologies since 2005 commented: “The data economy falls short of its promise for very valuable, highly confidential or regulated data. In a data-driven world, protecting data not only at rest and in transit, but also in-use, is paramount. Combined with the increasing need for organizations to work together with others, both for collaborations and valorization, and progress towards more protections for citizens and customer data through regulations like GDPR, robust applied cryptography solutions that combine the best privacy-enhancing technologies are of greatest importance in all domains. At Tune Insight, our vision is to transform the paradigm of the data economy into an insight economy that better protects sensitive data, that is more secure, fair, and protective of privacy and confidentiality rights”. Fostering Secure Insight Tune Insight will deploy this funding round to strengthen its position for confidential collaborative analytics and machine learning in healthcare, financial services and cybersecurity, strengthen sales and marketing teams, and accelerate international expansion in Europe and the US. Edoardo Ermotti, Founder and Managing Partner of 14Peaks Capital, commented: “Tune Insight stands at the forefront of addressing a critical gap in the realm of confidential collaborative analytics. Their software, situated at the intersection of AI/ML, SaaS, and data security, offers compelling applications across industries, including financial services. This aligns seamlessly with the core values and strategic focus we have at 14Peaks Capital. We are excited about this partnership and look forward to contributing to Tune Insight's next phase of growth, continuing to revolutionize enterprise collaboration on sensitive and regulated data while mitigating the customary associated risks.” Alexander Lange, Founding Partner at Inflection.xyz remarked: “We believe that AI's bottlenecks won't be software development, tooling or algorithms but access to raw compute and high quality data sets. Tune Insight is making a breakthrough contribution to the latter by building an operating system for model training on confidential data without leakage. For the first time, adversarial stakeholders operating across multiple levels of a given value chain are economically motivated to collaborate. This will lead to significant efficiency gains and better products for their customers.” Pascal Mathis, Founding Partner, Wingman Ventures, added: “Tune Insight is the poster child of a Swiss startup on its way to global success: born on deep technology from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, with a complementary team of experienced international co-founders, supported by the Swiss startup ecosystem, and signing as first customers Swiss companies that are world leaders in healthcare and financial services. Tune Insight is now ready to build on those early successes to accelerate towards becoming a global leader in secure collective data analytics and machine learning across industries.

The funds will accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology in the construction and building industry. The production of cement alone accounts for 8% of global carbon emissions. With no direct alternative material and the demand for concrete, and subsequently cement, expected to grow by 25% by 2050, urgent solutions are needed to lower its carbon footprint. Nanogence , a Renens (Vaud)-based startup, developed its proprietary smart catalyst technology, which are patented smart activators that enhances the binding efficiency of cementitious and inorganic binder systems. During the hydration process, it effectively activates the right chemical speciation to combine to selectively form an elevated amount of higher density connecting crystals that are responsible for binding all aggregates together, giving the final strength and durability. The formation of the right crystal and their quantity is the key to getting ultra-high performance on strength. The technology can also be integrated at cement production level to reduce the clinker content, the central and most carbon emission intensive ingredient, in cement without compromising product performance and, more importantly, without costly changes in the current manufacturing process. This saves up to 40 percent of carbon emissions without changing the current manufacturing process. The startup’s recent financing round attracted lead investor CirCap , a novel investment platform providing strategic private capital to innovative companies active in climate-tech, healthcare and educational sectors. The firm has €500 million assets under management. Planet First Partners , a growth equity sustainable investment platform, with Limited Partners’ commitments of 450 million euro, participated through its ecosystem investment strategy designed to support high-potential companies in progressing to the growth stage of their development. The round was completed by the EIC Fund, the venture arm of the European Innovation Council. Andreea Constantinescu, Managing Partner at Planet First Partners, said: “Our investment in Nanogence marks our first foray in the material innovation space and we stand committed to support Abhishek Kumar and the team in their scale up journey. We believe that Nanogence is well-placed to support the global decarbonisation of cement given its ability to meet the industry needs for financial and technological viability, material carbon reduction, ease of adoption and scalability.” Abhishek Kumar, CEO and Founder of Nanogence, commented: “We are excited to receive the support from incoming renowned investors in this essential journey to accelerate the transition towards a low carbon-built world. With growing demand worldwide, it is essential for us to align with like-minded strong backers for our growth phase.” The funds will boost the operations and manufacturing capabilities in multiple geographies, as demand for low-carbon solutions and smart catalyst technology increases across the construction and building industry globally.

The funds will support further developments and growing the team. By the end of 2021 , there were 300 million crypto users worldwide, with most of them having their funds sitting on centralised exchanges (CEX) – this number is anticipated to grow further. The recent events in the crypto space have shown that centralisation can be biased by humans making bad decisions and having the wrong intentions. A better alternative is Decentralised Finance (DeFi), an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. According to Consensys , there are 4.7 million DeFi users, which is approximately a 100X less than crypto users. Liquidity on-chain is also growing faster than on CEX. DeFi is, however, very fragmented, with multiple services and not easily accessible to retail users, which limits the adoption and growth of the DeFi ecosystem. To enable the mass adoption for DeFi, Gauthier Vila founded Ondefy in 2021. The startup offers a solution structured with two main features: the Fiat-to-any token feature, which allows easy onboarding to any token with fiat. The solution enables crypto startups to offer a simple and convenient way for their retail customers to access their tokens. The process can be completed in just three steps using a single URL, email address, and credit card. This solution is also useful for non-experienced DeFi users The DeFi Marketplace is a simplified DeFi Meta Aggregator for retail users. For this feature, Ondefy aggregates DeFi most demanded services in one place while abstracting on-chain complexity. Users can then view the assets they bought, discover new tokens, generate yield, and swap at the best rate with our Meta DEX aggregator.

Renowned business angels participated in the round. Rflect is addressing the skills crisis in higher education caused by two megatrends: the ever-increasing pace of technological development and the fact that society is not on track to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These challenges make it crucial for universities to educate today’s students in more than just technical skills to foster personal development and drive social change. However, existing interventions for student personal development, like coaching, seminars and learning diaries, are expensive and cumbersome, with most universities lacking the know-how to do so successfully. Co-founded by serial entrepreneurs Niels Rot (Impact Hub Zürich, STRIDE Learning), Ivan Jovanovic, and Ella Stadler-Stuart,  the Zurich-based startup is pioneering a new solution to enable high education institutes to seamlessly integrate personal development into existing university study programs. Co-developed with their partners, the platform acts as a personal development companion, integrated smoothly into students’ curriculum. The web app will provide students with regular prompts for self-reflection and benefit from peer coaching and insight-to-action challenges. The startup aims to contribute to the 2021-launched Inner Development Goals , a comprehensive international framework for the skills necessary for people not only to thrive in life but also to actively contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The additional funding will be used primarily for the further development of a second-generation vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Founded in 2019 as a subsidiary of Swiss Rockets AG , RocketVax is a Basel-based biotech company that uses proprietary technologies in molecular biology and chemistry to engineer novel vaccines. The company is currently developing three live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in parallel. The COVID-19 vaccines RVX-sCPD9 and RVX-OTS are slow-replicating SARS-CoV-2 viruses while the COVID-19 vaccine RVX-13 is based on a genetically modified SARS-CoV-2 virus that cannot replicate. All three vaccines have two outstanding features: they increase the protection of the immune system and lead to the generation not only of spike antibodies but also of a broad spectrum of other antibodies and T cells. This should provide longer-lasting protection against wild-type viruses and all virus variations (caused by mutations). In addition, the stability of the vaccine at ambient temperatures is good, which allows the protection of populations in Africa, Latin America and other emerging markets and reduces the risk of the emergence of new viral variants. With already two financing rounds, RocketVax has attracted new experienced investors to participate in its third round. The lead investor is the Foundation of Urs and Simone Wietlisbach, which acquired 9 percent of the shares of RocketVax. Urs Wietlisbach is one of the three founders of the Partners Group, one of the leading investment companies. Family offices and private investors also contributed to the round. The funds will support the further development of RocketVax’s various projects. These primarily include a second-generation vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such a vaccine is important as the virus continues to cause significant health damage. In Western countries, masks are rarely worn and the statistical excess mortality caused by the virus remains significant. The virus can also trigger various chronic diseases. Vladimir Cmiljanovic, Vice President of RocketVax, states that “Despite the very difficult environment, we have managed to secure reputable investors who have invested significant amounts. We still believe that the RocketVax vaccine is urgently needed, and we are now moving forward with its development with increased momentum.” (Press release/RAN)"

The second fundraising campaign via the crowdfunding platform seedrs is also off to a good start. The total amount raised so far exceeds the company’s target goal. MPower built a B2B platform to provide small- and medium-scale solar energy solutions in emerging markets. Its decentralised, high-quality plug-and-play solar devices and energy-efficient household and income-generating appliances provide electricity to lower- and middle-income households, SMEs, and farmers in Africa. The company also offers a financing model to partners and their end-users and in-house software solutions to help distributors optimise their operations. In addition to its presence in Zambia, Togo, Cameroon and Namibia, the company also started operations in Ghana end of last year, increasing its total headcount to 36 people. The expansion and soaring demand have resulted in the deployment of more than 30,000 units through more than 20 distribution partners. MPower has thus delivered electricity to more than 50,000 Africans living in hard-to-reach and peri-urban areas. Ready to scale Over 500 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, and millions are connected to unreliable grids. Although solar and storage technologies have become the preferred power source, several challenges inhibit growth in the market. This presents a huge market potential for MPower. The company has thus built its infrastructure to scale the business in further African countries. To finance the next growth phase and triple its impact in 2023, the company has secured equity around 1.5  million Euros received from new and existing investors as part of its pre-series A round. In addition, it has launched a crowd equity campaign on one of Europe’s largest platforms, Seedrs , to top its EUR 1M target. Since the campaign launch last week, MPower has received a total of more than €682,000 from 344 investors. (RAN)"

The funds will also drive the first-in-human trials and regulatory clearance. Besides Ascend Capital Partners , an international venture capital firm focused on investments in MedTech and Mobility early-stage tech companies, Nanoflex Robotics' financing round was supported by European-based family offices, including Kinled Holding Ltd , an experienced medical device/robotics investor with a significant track record of identifying successful spin-outs from EPFL/ETH Zurich, and Mountain Labs AG , an incubator specialised in funding innovative technology. The project continues to receive support from ETH Zurich and Wyss Zurich . Nanoflex Robotics is a Zurich-based based MedTech start-up developing a proprietary robotic platform to navigate magnetic devices in complex vascular anatomy using precise electromagnetic fields. Its portfolio of products is intended to diagnose and treat vascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke, in a timely and safe manner. Its first product will be a compact and mobile electromagnetic field generator that can easily be moved between hospital interventional suites, requiring no additional infrastructure beyond a high-voltage electrical point and access to a water-based cooling system. The system allows direct tip control of magnetically adapted interventional devices, in contrast to conventional procedures where torque must often be transferred more than a meter down the length of devices to control tip direction. The fresh funds will enable the company to take the next steps, including initiating its clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. This will accelerate the time to market for its first-generation system and further development of new neuro-interventional products. Nanoflex Robotics was founded in Zurich in 2021 as a spinoff of the Multi-Scale Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich, based on more than 20 years of research. The founding team comprises Bradley Nelson, Christophe Chautems and Matt Curran. ""Nanoflex Robotics aims to revolutionize catheter-based treatment of neurovascular and vascular disease by enabling faster and safer access to target sites in the vasculature.

The startup has raised half a million Swiss francs in pre-seed financing led by SICTIC investors to advance its platform. In Switzerland, even if companies such as Givaudan, Swisscom, Roche or Sika1 have grown to become sustainability reporting leaders, only 16% of the 258 companies listed on the SIX Stock Exchange are reporting on their sustainability performances and practices based on internal research. Moreover, companies that are already reporting often only track their sustainability performance once a year, as part of the annual reporting cycle. This process is cumbersome as capturing the underlying data can involve hundreds of people and is managed through emails and spreadsheets. These ad-hoc reporting processes are error-prone, resource intensive, and keep companies from effectively and accurately evaluating their performances. With its solution, Pelt8 wants to accelerate climate action. The startup, founded in August 2021, offers a cloud platform with scalable processes and controls to collect sustainability-related data in an easy and auditable way, and generate automatically curated reports. By removing data collection complexity, the solution will enable companies to respond to the growing demand for transparency from upcoming regulations and reporting requirements. The platform supports international reporting standards and bespoke management reports. After launching the MVP in September 2022 they have experienced a growing demand for the Pelt8 platform. The company serves eight customers including AXA, SIX, Adnovum, TexAid, and Schenk. “With the ordinance on climate disclosures entering into effect in 2024, Pelt8 aims to position itself as the leading solution enabling companies in Switzerland to deal with their reporting needs in an efficient and auditable way,” said Gwen Jettain, Co-founder and CC0 at Pelt8. The proceeds from its new financing round will help the startup to strengthen its product and development team. Under the lead of SICTIC , the round saw the participation of experienced entrepreneurs Ralph Mogicato, and Andreas Bezner , Co-founder & CEO of Stableton. Individuals in the sustainability, technology and financial services sectors also joined the round. “We are excited to work with investors who share our vision to build a cohesive sustainability-tech ecosystem with Pelt8’s data management at the centre. We see the imminent need for tens of thousands of companies to get their sustainability reporting on par with their financial reporting. This is an opportunity to help companies to move away from reporting for reporting's sake and commit to measurable actions,” said Julian Osborne, founder and CEO of Pelt8. Pelt8 is a runner-up at the 2022 Swiss Fintech Awards and a winner of the Catapult Kickstarter program in Luxembourg. They have recently become a participant in the Swiss Triple Impact initiative, making commitments to create a positive impact beyond their solution."

Its CO2 capture device aims to decarbonize freight transport and supply chains. Retrofitted on heavy vehicles, it is projected to be one of the first mobile devices of its kind. Today, heavy-duty transport accounts for more than 10% of the EU's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Low-carbon solutions (hydrogen, electric) that are currently being developed to tackle this problem are facing one major challenge: their full implementation requires the entire infrastructure and fleet in circulation to be renewed. This can take decades. Qaptis is bridging the gap between the global ambition to decarbonize heavy transport to reach Net-Zero in 2050 and our industrial and infrastructural capacity to do it. Qaptis was born out of the EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne). Created in July 2021, the team is building an unprecedented device that is projected to capture up to 90% of the vehicle’s CO2 emissions. The device retrofits the existing internal combustion engines. Once attached to the exhaust pipe, it will capture CO2 by using the waste heat available at the exhaust. The power of this solution lies in its ability to bring immediate answers to the global emission challenges. With the Qaptis capture device there is no need to renew the existing fleet or change infrastructure. With low upfront costs, each transporter can take decarbonization in their own hands. Apart from investors, the potential of the Qaptis technology has already been appreciated by some of the major industry players. Validating the technology and expanding the team The initial funding provided by BlackWood , Cargill , YB Startup , Plug and Play and business angels is used to expand the engineering team of Qaptis and reach the Technology Readiness Level 5 (TRL 5). « We are thrilled and honored that top strategic investors and first clients are sharing our vision. Our carbon capture solution is an exciting promise to the market that needs to turn decarbonization ambitions into concrete actions. » Theodore Caby, Co-founder & CEO, Qaptis « Qaptis’ cutting-edge technology could provide the most pragmatic solution to allow for energy transition in road delivery and beyond.

Widespread disorder Metabolic Obstructive Sleep Apnea (MOSA) is characterized by obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that occurs when the muscles that support the soft tissues in the throat temporarily relax. Breathing is impaired or completely prevented causing blood oxygen levels to drop below the normal range. Low oxygen levels increase cardiac load and stress the nervous system which if left untreated increases significantly the risk for cardiovascular mortality. MOSA can also result in excessive daytime sleepiness and memory or concentration problems. Hundreds of millions of people around the globe are affected by MOSA. (Press release / SK)"

This could result in new therapeutics for patients with autoimmune diseases. The Basel- and Frankfurt-based company closed a financing round with High-Tech Gründerfonds. Being able to rebalance the immune response in acute and chronic inflammation is key for many patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Thanks to an innovative and patented technology, Phialogics brings a new answer to these unmet medical needs. Its strategy has the potential to provide new solutions for patients with autoimmune diseases by rebalancing their overactive immune response in selected organs and tissue. The concept is based on the targeted modification of immunoglobulin receptor domains (IgVs) to modulate immune response in inflammatory diseases. IgV mediated receptor-ligand interaction represents a significant source of novel biologics. Phialogics lead molecules replicate endogenous protein-protein interactions to efficiently modulate the function of their target receptor. So far, only this unique platform technology can achieve such a high level of precision. Current lead candidates are genetically engineered monospecific IgVs with the potential to be expanded to bispecific therapeutics to achieve selectivity for inflamed tissue and/or disease-causing immune cells. Andreas Ernst, Co-Founder & CEO of Phialogics comments: “For 2023, our goals are to further develop our lead candidate, completing proof of concept in preclinical models and comparing our lead to the standard of care. In addition, as a part of our new discovery project, we will expand our portfolio to novel bi-specific immune checkpoint modulators. This becomes possible thanks to the HTGF financing round.” Phialogics has been found in 2021 by a team of widely recognized experts in protein engineering and immunology based on research concepts established at the Fraunhofer Institute of Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, and the Medical Faculty of the Goethe-University Frankfurt. In September 2022 Phialogics joined the BaseLaunch portfolio. (Press release / SK)"

A Series B round will be opened this summer, after re-evaluation of the company to complete the Pilot Study and launch in its wake the Pivotal Study. Novostia SA, a clinical stage company developing a breakthrough artificial heart valve, has just raised an additional EUR 2.5 million. The total funds raised since its foundation in April 2017 in Neuchâtel, amount to just over 15 million and include public subsidies from the European Union and the Canton of Vaud. Novostia is based at Biopôle close to Lausanne and led by Alain Barbat. The Series A round which has now been closed enables the launch of First-in-Human (FIH) trials. A Series B will be opened this summer, after re-evaluation of the company. This Series B financing round will be used to complete the Pilot Study and launch in its wake the Pivotal Study which will enroll around 60 patients for the former and 500 for the latter. These studies will enable Novostia to obtain the necessary approvals (CE mark and Pre-Market Approval) to enter the market. Heart valve diseases affect more than 100 million people worldwide. Every year hundreds of thousands of patients undergo a heart valve replacement. Available technologies entail serious constraints: lifelong anticoagulant medication or further replacements due to limited valve durability. Thanks to a unique patented design and the use of a high-performance biocompatible polymer, the company led by Alain Barbat eliminates all these constraints. Experimental, numerical and animal testing demonstrates that the valve physiologically operates like a native human heart valve: it does not produce high velocity backflow jets, does not elicit an haemostatic response and thus is expected to function without anticoagulation therapy. Unlike tissue valves, which have limited durability, especially with young patients, the valve is structurally designed to last a lifetime for patients of any age, thereby avoiding the risk of a re-operation.

By using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, the Quazel team has been able to create an AI personal language tutor that can talk about anything and deeply understand the context of the conversation. With the app, users can, therefore, have conversations as they would with a tutor in a physical setting while getting a tailored learning structure suitable to their progress and interests. The app offers various features such as scene builder, which allows users to choose their counterpart and topic of discussion, and with gamification, they can earn points as they level up, making the learning journey enjoyable, engaging, and accessible. Following its launch, the app signed more than 50’000 users in just two days.  It currently supports 21 languages: English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Czech, Finnish, Indonesian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish and Ukrainian. The company has raised $1.5M in its seed financing round to make personalised and individual tutoring available to a broader audience. The funds will also enable the company to expand its team and advance the app. Khosla Venture, which also provides venture assistance and strategic advice to entrepreneurs working on breakthrough technologies, invested in Quazel. Founded in 2004 by Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the firm has over $15b assets under management. (RAN)"

The funding will allow expanding the team for a quick market entry. With the recent rise of advanced AI tools, many may fear that humans are becoming obsolete; however, this transformation is far from the truth. Human-powered data processing, such as annotation, validation, and assessment, is crucial for the development of AI tools. To work through these millions of repetitive tasks that need human intuition, Rapidata built a unique model that does not rely on a fixed workforce. Instead, they provide a ‘human processing unit in the cloud’ based on a huge network of users from around the world, or, in more metaphorical terms used by one of the investors, a “wetware” service, a play on the word “hardware” referring to the glibbery human brain. With its system, the startup can process large amounts of data with human intelligence and sentiment from specific regions within minutes. The technology has been deployed and verified on smaller projects, and the next step is scaling up to involve larger industry players. Customers will use the platform for typical AI data annotation types such as Classification, Ranking, Comparing, Bounding Boxes, Locating, Segmentation and Tracking. “We offer a self-serve platform , with which we hope to become the number one tool for human data annotation for all the Students, small Startups, Researchers etc., that are working on the AI Tools of the Future”, said Jason Corkill, Rapidata’s Founder and CEO. Interested users can test the platform for Comparing and Locating tasks. Incorporated in May 2023 by Jason Corkill, Marian Kannwischer, Luca Strebel and Mads Kuhlmann-Jørgensen, Rapidata has won new investors to support its next steps. Besides lead investor BlueYard , the round is significantly backed by Acequia Capital and an angel investor. “We’re thrilled by the confidence shown in our vision and platform with this funding round. The funds will significantly accelerate our scaling efforts and help to establish ourselves as a key player for AI data annotation and human data processing,” says Jason Corkill, Rapidata’s Founder and CEO. “High-quality labelled data and human feedback are critical differentiators for training AI models. Rapidata’s innovative approach to human-powered data processing dramatically reduces the cost and time required to develop AI models. We’re proud to support Rapidata in shaping the infrastructure of this new era.” - David Byrd, General Partner at BlueYard Capital. With prior investment rounds from Venturekick and the Wingman Campus fund totalling CHF 70,000, this round marks a significant step in Rapidata’s growth trajectory. The funds will be invested in expanding the team and reach in key markets, including the United States, where many of the key stakeholders in the AI industry reside. (Press release/RAN)"

The raised USD 2.3 million brings the company into the operations phase. Wingman Ventures led the investment round for Saeki Robotics , supported by Vento Ventures, Getty Capital and angel investors. With this funding, Saeki is now well-positioned to accelerate its development and launch its microfactories for concrete molds. Although additive manufacturing technologies have been here for a while, using 3D printing for large items, like wind turbine blades, aeroplanes and car parts, is still slow, and industry quality and scaling cannot yet be achieved. Moreover, to develop a lightweight carbon fibre element or to build a topologically optimised concrete floor slab, buyers would have to wait months and spend vast sums of money to receive a first sample and only then build a prototype, let alone consider reiterating for any flaws. ETH spinoff Saeki wants to fix these challenges by up-scaling additive manufacturing (AM) processes towards large-scale applications, focusing on concrete formwork. Founded in 2021 by Andrea Perissinotto, Oliver Harley and Matthias Leschok, Saeki SAEKI works with the architectural design, engineering design and construction services industry to turn complex designs into reality, save concrete and CO2. They developed a new method to produce custom concrete formwork cost-effectively and with minimal material usage. The startup is working on a large-scale automated digital fabrication (dfab) cell ( > 4m3 ) comprising an industrial robot, tool-changing equipment, and a software package, allowing a user-friendly design-to-product workflow. The startup is building its first production hub containing industrial robots that combine multiple digital manufacturing methods, from 3D printing, milling, and inspection to create an all-in-one low-waste production process and recyclable materials. The robots will act as microfactories; self-contained units able to do all the manufacturing steps, and easily deployable for localised manufacturing. Additionally, SAEKI will offer a quoting platform tailored to the customers' own business needs to remove the complex opaque approach currently in the market. It also plans to work with the composites industry, which builds the lightweight but strong parts found on airplanes, cars and bikes, among other things. These parts are usually made in complex molds created from metal or composite materials. Perissinotto said this creates a bottleneck for companies because the molds are expensive and need a long time to build. SAEKI’s goal is to reduce lead time costs and use its tooling processes to enable companies in the composites industry to have faster hardware production cycles.

During the past two decades, Opterion has been working on the first major innovation in peritoneal dialysis (PD), which uses the body’s own peritoneal membrane within the abdomen as the filter to clean the blood. Unlike Hemodialysis, the PD procedure is gentle and can be self-administered at home or on the move. The Opterion solutions also help reduce insulin dosage and glucose-related diabetic challenges. Animal studies have shown the superiority of the Opterion PD solution over the ‘gold standard’ of the current market leader. Thanks to the closing of its oversubscribed financing round with private and institutional investors, the startup is now set to complete ongoing preclinical activities and progress towards clinical trials. As part of this capital round, an additional option capital of CHF 7.3m was issued.

Along with the investment, the startup signed new contracts with global corporations Holcim, Mediclinic, and Tetra Pak, joining existing customers who used the platform to create new customer experiences, products, patents, and spinoffs. Innovation remains an ongoing challenge for mature organisations. Hierarchy, gut feeling, and fear of failure often stifle innovation or misdirect it. Still, the threat of disruption and the “war for talent” has motivated enterprises to find a solution to those barriers. With its flagship product, rready combines a SaaS platform for visibility, innovation accounting, and project execution with a physical KICKBOX (literally, a box) that guides employees through formulating, vetting, and launching innovations. KICKBOX is an open-source innovation methodology invented by serial entrepreneur Mark Randall. Different from a mere project management platform, rready provides a network of service providers and coaches who can be hired on demand to fill gaps and keep a project moving. More than 40 global companies, including 3M, Cisco, Caterpillar, MasterCard, P&G, and Swisscom have used the platform to validate thousands of employees’ ideas and implement hundreds of projects. Most recently, Siemens Energy secured 12 new patents in 18 months; Implenia’s patented, eco-friendly tunnel construction method while Swisscom’s automated video streaming product for sports resulted in the creation of the spinoff company Asport. The newly added customers Holcim, Mediclinic, and Tetra Pak, aspire to achieve new innovations with rready. Series A round of $4 million The proceeds from its $4 million Series A round will be used to grow its customer base, expand its product portfolio and commercialise the newly built AI-powered platform. The API-first software supports different use cases such as open innovation, hackathons, accelerators, or continuous improvement ideas. The latest solution has already delivered $8 million in cost savings and revenue during a yearlong pilot at a company with a $30B+ market cap. With that, rready has become the leading provider of an innovation operating system for corporates looking for a scalable solution leading to measurable results. Alongside lead investor FYRFLY Venture Partners, EquityPitcher , Verve , Swisscom Ventures , and angel investors also participated. The round also includes non-dilutive debt capital from UBS . As part of the Series A round, Mark Randall has officially joined rready’s board of directors along with Roger Wüthrich, former Chief Digital Officer at Swisscom. Commenting on the methodology he said, “While creativity is innately human, KICKBOX showed the world how to channel employee creativity into tangible innovation in an enterprise context. rready’s breakthrough was to adapt KICKBOX innovation into a repeatable, scalable process that companies can deploy in the most impactful, measurable way. The result is a platform organisations worldwide are using to drive a predictable funnel of innovations.” (Press release/RAN) Photo: rready's founding team"

Candidates spend hours browsing job boards, crafting their resume and cover letter, and preparing for interviews. And even after all that, they may not get the job they want. On the other hand, hiring the right talent can be equally challenging. Companies have to examine hundreds of applications, conduct multiple rounds of interviews, and decide based on limited information. Despite the long process, the selected candidate may not be the right fit. The newly launched platform FOUND is transforming the hiring process using a different approach that leverages Artificial Intelligence matching technology and data-driven insights. Instead of talent applying to companies, employers access the FOUND community of pre-assessed top talent, get matched to those that perfectly fit their criteria and then video pitch to those they are most interested in. This way, the platform provides a faster, more efficient, and unbiased alternative for employers to find quality talent and for talent to access opportunities. Found was incorporated in October 2022, and since the go-live in March this year, the platform has attracted more than 700 top talent and 70 fast-growing startups/scaleups such as Calingo, Loanboox, Properti and Starmind, enabling the startup to establish a strong presence in the Swiss market. Following this successful launch and the closing of its seed financing round, FOUND is braced for the next phase.

The Startup has closed its first institutional investment round, raising $8 million from prominent climate VCs Energy Impact Partners (EIP) and Contrarian Ventures. With Aviation responsible for around 2% of global CO2 emissions—some 800 million tonnes annually, decarbonising this sector remains a major technological challenge. Barriers facing electrification and hydrogen, which face complications in logistics and aircraft design and will not work for long-haul, mean that viable solutions for travel using these technologies are many years away from being ready for the go-to-market. In an industry where single aircraft are currently intended to have a lifespan of 30 years and cost around $100 million apiece, the cost of reframing fleets for hydrogen and e-aviation is economically impossible for most long-haul carriers. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from Metafuels will help to overcome these challenges. Made using renewable electricity (eSAF), it has developed aerobrew , a proprietary technology that turns green methanol into SAF. The fuel will replace normal kerosene regardless of the size and type of aircraft or whether it operates short-haul or long-haul. Unlike the competition, Metafuels’ approach achieves the lowest cost of production through high efficiency and ultra-high yield of SAF as well as up to 90% reduction of life cycle emissions eSAF does not require the re-engineering or re-purchase of planes—nor a redesign of the underlying fueling infrastructure, which supports both commercial and cargo airlines, route planning, or the existing customer experience, making it an attractive and versatile option. “Metafuels takes green methanol produced from renewable electricity and sustainable sources of carbon and—through a two-step process—turns it into jet fuel,” says Saurabh Kapoor, CEO and co-founder of Metafuels, who started the business with Leigh Hackett and Ulrich Koss in 2021. Since then, the team has grown into a highly experienced team of specialists from diverse backgrounds—including commercial and project development, working alongside a team of engineers and scientists. “We don’t want people to fly less; we want them to be able to do so more—to experience other cultures, and to play a role in a globalised economy—without a negative climate impact.” The proceeds from its funding round will be used to set up a pilot facility at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) — with whom the company recently announced a collaboration . As part of the work performed within this project, the team has successfully synthesised, tested, and validated a novel catalytic system based on advances in nanotechnology that form the core of aerobrew.

GliaPharm SA is an EPFL Spinoff specialising in the research and development of novel therapies to treat and prevent neurological diseases. Founded in 2017, GliaPharm has established a pipeline of compounds through its in-house proprietary drug discovery platform GliaX focused on glial cell function. These compounds aim to promote brain energy metabolism by specifically targeting glial cells. One of the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, is reduced glucose uptake in the brain, a condition known as hypometabolism. This metabolic decline occurs before symptoms arise and persists as the disease progresses. There are currently no specific treatments to address this problem in Alzheimer’s disease. The company is currently developing its lead candidate GP-119 towards clinical testing through IND/CTA-enabling studies, which are mandatory to gain approval for clinical testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe. The $4.2 million investment from the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) , a non-profit organisation dedicated to accelerating drug discovery and development in Alzheimer’s disease, will bring GliaPharm’s lead compound GP-119 to the clinical stage. GP-119 is a novel, orally active small molecule that acts on brain energy metabolism. “While the brain is only about two percent of the body’s weight, it consumes about a quarter of the body’s energy in glucose stores, which is why it’s believed that poor brain metabolism can lead to neurodegeneration,” says Dr Howard Fillit, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer at the ADDF. “Developing new drugs that seek to regulate brain metabolism in the ageing body like GliaPharm’s GP-119 is a promising approach for treating Alzheimer’s and related dementias, as we hope to develop an arsenal of drugs that can stop the disease in its tracks through combination therapy and precision medicine.” “This comes as a strong validation for GliaPharm’s Alzheimer’s program and a solid partner for future developments,” adds Ambroise Magistretti, GliaPharm’s co-CEO and co-founder. “The support from the ADDF will be key to advancing our lead program through preclinical regulatory studies, which will be followed by clinical trials. We are enthusiastic about the ADDF’s strategy to support novel and potentially complementary therapeutic solutions for Alzheimer’s disease, including our own approach to tackle brain hypometabolism,” says Dr. Charles Finsterwald, GliaPharm’s CSO and co-founder.

Since its launch and placement on Manor’s retail shelves, the company has had a remarkable growth trajectory, bringing it to a break-even point. The fresh capital from business angels will boost its growth and help expand the team. After ten years as a brand director at Procter & Gamble and Coty, Sergio Panzarella established Food for Health (FFH) in 20219, with Olixir ® an organic extra-virgin olive oil with a superior level of freshness, heart-protective polyphenols, fruitiness, and taste. It is made from a secret combination of three olive varieties. Besides the olive oil, Olixir also offers a range of organic olives and olive oil pressed with Sicilian lemons. FFH is vertically integrated, controlling all steps in the value chain, from field to sales, to maximize taste, aromas, and health-boosting micronutrients. “Our goal is to address the paradoxical and widely accepted practice in the market, where olive oils from the new harvest are not made available on shelves until the second semester of the following year, causing them to lose a significant amount of their freshness and quality. This practice deprives consumers of the pleasure and health benefits of fresh, high-quality extra virgin olive oil. Low shelf rotations, ineffective stock management, lack of transparency and limited consumer education are some of the key reasons behind this problem. Our strategic approach addresses these challenges and provides consumers with a superior quality extra virgin olive oil that lives up to its name”, said Panzarella, Founder & CEO of Food for Health. The Olixir® brand is currently available at select retail partners like Manor, Kiss the Ground, and Organy. Several prestigious chefs at even three 1-star Michelin restaurants trust the brand. In addition to its olive oil, FFH plans to apply the same model to other natural packaged food verticals. The company has now raised CHF 110k in a pre-seed funding round with five angel investors, including Twenty-Three Capital GmbH, Nico-Hribernik (Wellster Health-tech Group, Twenty-Three Capital GmbH), Jaime-Martin (Edrington), Cristian Mazzoleni (Kiko) and others.

Revenue and breakeven after only three years Initially, Panzarella bootstrapped the startup’s launch with a $150k personal investment. Within a year of launching, the company had reached six digits in revenue. In 2022, FFH accelerated its growth in Switzerland by launching at Manor, where it now counts among the top three brands.

However, based on feedback from over 10’000 creators, this segment faces three main challenges: unfair rules and abuses by the platforms, huge commission fees (between 20% and 50%), and lack of Privacy and Time Waste due to outdated user experience (UX). To address these challenges, particularly for the Business/Content Metaverse segment, MetaStudio Land AG established MetaStudio , a metaverse platform based on Smart Contracts and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for anyone to sell content with total privacy, retain ownership, receive all the profit and make decisions. Based on ETH and built on Polygon technology and in collaboration with Polygon Labs, the platform allows users to use multi-coin wallets and make transactions instantly with minimal costs. Besides being content creators, platform users can take on roles as streamers, coaches or freelancers. Being a Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAO), content creators, users, investors, and all $METAS holders can decide by democratic vote on all aspects of the platform governance, from setting up rules to implementing them to the platform’s future trajectory and finance.

With the closing of its pre-seed round, the company has raised CHF 480’000 to start pilot production and enter the cosmetic ingredients market. Gaia Tech emerged from an innovative research project at ETH Zurich with the aim of developing technologies that can unlock and market valuable resources found in byproducts from the agro-food sector, primarily olive sidestreams. Agricultural waste contains many resources that could replace synthetic compounds used in the cosmetic and food industries; however, this waste mostly gets discarded without being valorized. With its proprietary extraction technology, Gaia offers a modular and scalable solution to enable the industry to replace harmful chemicals with renewable biocompounds. Gaia Tech has achieved promising market validation. According to the head of biological evaluation at an ingredients provider, Gaia Tech has “the best antioxidant technology we tested so far”. Furthermore, the startup has received significant recognition for its groundbreaking work,  environmental friendliness and efficiency; most recently, it won the De Vigier Award, receiving CHF 100’000 prize money. Dr Enrico Tenaglia, Co-founder and head of product development, emphasized, “Our technology not only offers a sustainable solution for agricultural waste but also presents a new stream of high-value ingredients for cosmetics, food, pet food, and animal feed manufacturers. We believe this approach creates a win-win situation for the industry and the environment.” The startup has now closed its first investment round, which saw the participation of SICTIC business angels, Venture Kick , and the STI Foundation . With the capital increase, the startup has changed the legal structure from GmbH to AG and in the next phase, it will focus on establishing pilots with leading industry partners.

The raised capital of CHF 33 million from the series A round will accelerate its pipeline of preclinical and clinical vaccine candidates. Co-led by Adjuvant Capital , AXA IM Alts , and the Novo Holdings REPAIR Impact Fund , this Series A investment round is the first venture-backed investment round for LimmaTech since it was spun out of GlycoVaxyn in 2015. The proceeds will enable LimmaTech to advance its proprietary technology platform and accelerate its pipeline of preclinical and clinical vaccine candidates against increasingly dangerous bacterial infections. There is an increasing threat of global infections due to emerging antimicrobial resistance, responsible for approximately 5 million deaths annually. While antibiotic treatments have been effective, inappropriate or excessive use of antibiotics has caused bacteria to develop natural resistance to these agents. Currently, half of the approximately 700,000 annual gonorrhea infections in the U.S. are already resistant to antibiotics, and there is a real threat of gonorrhea soon becoming untreatable. This development is also projected for a growing number of other infections, such as Shigella sp ., in both developed and low- and middle-income countries. LimmaTech’s proprietary clinical pipeline comprises an innovative vaccine against gonorrhoea based on a set of novel and highly conserved antigens. Its strategy is to overcome the natural immune evasion mechanisms of Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and to be globally efficacious. The vaccine is based on a versatile platform that allows the company to combine multiple antigens in a single production batch whilst also incorporating an optimised adjuvant. Clinical trials are anticipated to begin the first clinical trial in 2025. In parallel, Limmatech has later-stage clinical developments focused on the company’s Shigella vaccine program, which LimmaTech developed as part of a joint collaboration with GSK and recently exclusively in-licensed . The company expects to announce preliminary results from the Shigella program’s ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2023. New CEO and Board members For its next growth phase, LimmaTech has welcomed seasoned biotech industry leader Dr. Franz-Werner Haas as CEO. “…By advancing our innovative technology platform, LimmaTech has the potential to simultaneously provide vaccine-induced protection against bacterial infections, mitigate the increasing risk of antibiotic resistance, and move toward the control of several highly transmissible pathogens,” said Franz-Werner Haas, CEO of LimmaTech. “Our Series A with backing from highly experienced and strategic institutional investors, reflects the increasing value of our technology and our achievements to date. With this support and our team of proven experts in bacterial vaccine development and manufacturing, we look forward to providing life-changing vaccines to address a major global medical need.” Additionally, the company has appointed Kabeer Aziz from Adjuvant Capital, Zina Affas Besse, PhD, from AXA IM Alts, and Camilla Petrycer Hansen, PhD from Novo Holdings to its Board of Directors.

The company is developing technologies and services that are needed to extend the life of active satellites, for example when they run out of fuel, and to safely remove them from orbit when they have reached their end of life. Such services are critical for maximising the value from space-based assets, and for preventing the dangerous build-up of space debris objects. The company recently announced a satellite life-extension collaboration with satcom operator Intelsat, building upon the technology being developed under the EUR 110 million space debris removal mission, ClearSpace-1, secured from the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2020. ClearSpace-1, which is supported by Omega as Elite Partner, will be the first of numerous missions ClearSpace is planning for both low-Earth and geostationary orbits. Global consortium of investors The new financing round brings together a global team of venture capital investors, led by OTB Ventures backed by the European Investment Fund under InvestEU programme and Swisscom Ventures , with participation from the Luxembourg Future Fund , Lakestar , In-Q-Tel , Happiness Capital and 600 T Space Investments. As part of the financing, ClearSpace is establishing an operational presence in Luxembourg that will benefit from the strong space and satellite focus there. ClearSpace Co-founders, CEO Luc Piguet and CTO Muriel Richard-Noca said “We began this company 4 years ago with the goal of making space operations sustainable and are delighted to be joined on our journey by our new partner investors. The market is now developing, much faster than we had expected, and we look forward to accelerating our activities to meet the urgent needs of space sustainability.” Dominique Megret of Swisscom Ventures said “Swisscom Ventures is delighted to back our Swiss made champion ClearSpace in its mission to make space operations sustainable, ClearSpace is a deep tech landmark, and we look forward to working with the team going forward.” (Press release / SK)"

Mitochondria are intimately tied to the origin of complex life, the energy of the young and the decline of the old. They generate most of its needed energy and operate as critical intra-cellular communication nodes. Mitochondria dysfunction has been tied to a host of diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative ailments, over heart attacks and strokes, to age-related degeneration. “Given the insights gained and treatment successes shown by my scientific co-founders, we have always viewed mitochondria as a potential new category of medicines”, says Alexander Schueller, co-founder and CEO of cellvie . “To realize the modality’s potential, we have therefore focused our efforts over the past two years on scalable productization – developing an allogeneic off-the-shelf product – and research on new therapeutic applications of mitochondria – such as in gene therapy delivery and aging related degeneration.” Preparation for Series A With this additional funding, cellvie intends to accelerate and expand the scientific development of its mitochondria platform and to further strengthen the organizational foundations in preparation for the Series A. Dr. Schueller notes that “while many companies need to conserve cash and slow down shortly before raising their next round of funding, we are now in the position to speed up and form an even stronger basis to immediately and efficiently put the Series A funding to work.” Potential in the fight against cancer The financing was led by Taiho Ventures LLC , with participation of existing investors, including the Series Seed lead, Kizoo Technology Capital GmbH. Taiho Ventures LLC will take a board seat to help the company realize its ambitions. “We have recognized the tremendous potential in the therapeutic use of mitochondria, particularly in the fight against cancer, and we believe that cellvie is very well positioned to become a leader in this emerging field”, says Sakae Asanuma, President and CEO at Taiho Ventures LLC. Kizoo is also a significant co-investor in this round, having gained ever more confidence in the technology and the potential of the team since leading the company's seed round in 2020. Frank Schueler, Managing Director at Kizoo and member of the board at cellvie says: “The team has done a tremendous job in advancing our understanding and pushing the boundaries of mitochondria-based therapies. So it was only natural for us to continue to support cellvie as one of our key startups.” Harvard spin-off The company was founded by James McCully, Alexander Schueller, Pedro del Nido and Sitaram Emani in 2018. James McCully pioneered the approach of Therapeutic Mitochondria Transplantation at Harvard Medical School. “Whilst Mitochondria have been known as disease targets for a long time, treating them has proven challenging”, notes McCully. That’s why he turned to transplanting viable mitochondria to reinvigorate the cell energy metabolism, which was impaired due to ischemia, an undersupply of oxygen which arises in medical conditions such as heart attacks or stroke and during organ transplantation.

The solution provides a crucial gateway into digital payments and credit cards for the unbanked. With this approach, sending remittances and peer-to-peer transactions is easier. CCHF is today positioned as the ideal digital payment token, backed by a Swiss Bank Guarantee. To fuel its growth, the Zurich-based startup has finalised a €1.8 million seed financing round led by Archblock and Bloomhaus Ventures with continued investments from existing shareholders and founders. The funds will fuel Centi’s mission to revolutionise digital transactions on a global scale. “We founded Centi driven by the potential of blockchain for micropayments and financial inclusion” states Bernhard Müller, Co-Founder of Centi. “The name ‘Centi’, derived from our capability to process transactions as small as one cent, encapsulates this focus. The success of our financing round is a testament to being on the right trajectory and receiving support for our mission to revolutionize current payment processes with the Centi stablecoin.” Expressing his enthusiasm, Alex de Lorraine CEO of Archblock, said, “Our investment signifies our belief in Centi’s potential to innovate in the fintech landscape.

EverdreamSoft is incubating the Wakweli project until the creation of a dedicated foundation, at the end of Q2 2023. Although NFTs have been advanced as a means of proving asset ownership, NFT scams and cases of copyright infringement have become commonplace. Wakweli hopes to solve such issues by ensuring that digital representations of assets are genuine and unique, i.e. not being represented by multiple tokens across the cryptosphere. The funding will enable the company to roll out its product offerings, including a community-driven core protocol that enables NFT marketplaces, buyers, and creators to benefit from a provable mark of authenticity for NFTs and other tokenized assets. Blockchain investment firm Summit led the seed round alongside FunFair Ventures and several business angels, with dozens of early investors pledging capital to back Wakweli’s vision of a protocol based on a decentralized consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Democracy (PoD). “We are incredibly thrilled and fortunate to have onboarded investors and partners who share Wakweli’s vision to increase trust in the web3 ecosystem,” said Co-Founder and CEO Shaban Shaame. Incubated by software firm EverdreamSoft , the Geneva-based Wakweli project was founded in 2021 and aims to become the reference of trust for the decentralized ecosystem, preserving the market integrity of tokenized assets and driving its liquidity. Co-founder and CEO Shaban Shaame brings a wealth of blockchain gaming experience to the project, as does Co-founder Markéta Kortéova, who also serves as the Chief Operating Officer of EverdreamSoft. Wakweli’s third Co-Founder, tech veteran Antoine Sarraute, has been an ardent advocate of decentralized tech since 2011 and has developed multiple innovative projects within the web3, AI, and fintech space. Wakweli launched its website, whitepaper and Alpha last year. This year, a dedicated foundation will be created to manage the venture, which encourages projects to build on its layers and apply for token grants distributed by its on-chain treasury."

The existing investors have made a further million euros available to the Yverdon-based start-up. Harnessing renewable resources and waste heat, ExerGo helps its customers save up to 80% in primary energy compared to fossil fuel-based systems. In addition, the startup uses CO₂ as a working fluid in a closed system, differentiating itself from water-based heating and cooling networks. This makes the system up to nine times denser, and significantly smaller and faster to deploy, with up to 60% savings in network installation cost. With its all-year-round operating pilot plant in Sion (Valais, Switzerland), which held an open-house inauguration welcoming more than 80 leaders in the energy- and cleantech sector last year, and with multiple commercialization projects in the pipeline, the startup is laser-focused on blazing a new path toward sustainable energy. In addition to last year’s seed funding round of €3.2 million, the cleantech start-up has secured another €1 million in capital to accelerate its commercialization and expand its operation into new markets. The investments come from its existing investors EREN Groupe , Baker Hughes and a private investor. This growth support is further sustained by the development partners Swiss Climate Foundation and The Foundation for Technological Innovation (FIT). The activation of the investments’ options demonstrates the investors’ trust in ExerGo’s technology. Vincent Eckert, Managing Director, Swiss Climate Foundation, comments: “We need innovative technologies to accelerate the decarbonization of our cities. ExerGo, supported by the Swiss Climate Foundation, develops an urgently needed solution to transfer heat and cold with efficient networks for high-density urban areas. This allows the use of residual heat and cold, that would be wasted otherwise.” As ExerGo continues to advance its technology and gain recognition, the startup prides itself that more and more utilities, municipalities, and private companies worldwide are warming up to such innovative solutions. The startup is also expanding its services to the real estate market, where it will meet more than 2,500 professionals at RENT – Switzerland’s leading real estate event – to present its compact thermal network.

Surgeons are therefore empowered with choice and control."" Dexter makes robotic surgery more accessible, enabling a wider adoption of robotic surgery. Dexter is easily integrated into clinical practice – it requires no additional infrastructure, it fits into every clinical setting, and it is mobile allowing for easy sharing across departments.

The funds will be used to bring EBAMed’s CardioKit system up to the completion of its First in Human trials. Heart arrhythmias affect around 50 million individuals worldwide and are expected to grow in the next 50 years as the population ages. Ventricular arrhythmias affect the lower chambers of the heart and consist primarily of ventricular tachycardias, or VTs, and premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs. EBAMed’s CardioKit system is used for a non-invasive treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia through Proton Therapy. It automatically adjusts cardiac radiation ablation systems for cardiac motion and increases external beam delivery precision. The development of a radiation therapy approach, combined with a unique motion monitoring and gating solution, will fill an important need for alternatives to either drug therapy or catheter-based ablation, and for reduced radiation of healthy myocardium.

With the closing of its seed financing round, the startup is now well-positioned to scale up its technology to reduce plastic waste by an additional 500 tonnes annually. The oversubscribed funding round was co-led by BASF Venture Capital and Wingman Ventures , with the participation of Beiersdorf , Infinity Recycling , CIECH Ventures , Zürcher Kantonalbank , Angel Invest , ACE & Company , and others supporting the startup in its mission to tackle the plastic recycling problem. Plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be found in many of our daily items, such as clothing, packaging, and outdoor equipment. Unfortunately, the high costs and difficulty required for sorting, separating, and cleaning these complex plastic streams, coupled with a lack of globally scaled solutions mean that only so-called perfect (clean, simple composition without other materials mixed) plastics get recycled. While 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced annually, less than 10% are recycled, with the majority entering incineration centers or landfills around the world. Founded in 2021 by Samantha Anderson (CEO), Bardiya Valizadeh (CTO), and Christopher Ireland (CSO), DePoly addresses the entire waste plastic problem with its chemical recycling technology. Currently, it converts all PET plastics and polyester textiles—originally sourced from fossil fuels—back into their main raw chemical components. The components are then sold back to the industry to make new virgin-quality plastic items, creating a truly sustainable circular plastic economy. DePoly’s chemical recycling technology operates at room temperature and standard pressure and does not require any pre-washing, pre-sorting, pre-melting, or separating out other plastics or materials, unlike most of the technologies out there. The technology is energy efficient, can be implemented quickly, and is easy to tailor to a customer's specific needs. Braced to scale To date, with a team of 13 people, the startup has built and operates a pilot plant that processes a capacity of 50 tonnes per year of these complex PET or polyester plastic streams, showcasing the scope and flexibility of how the technology works for various industries ranging from post-consumer packaging to textiles, fashion, and post-industrial streams. Using the proceeds from its seed round, the company aims to build a new showcase plant with a capacity of 500 tonnes per year to demonstrate the technology at a commercial scale. Samantha Anderson, CEO and co-founder of DePoly, said, “Plastics are a part of our lives and an existential dilemma facing us all. The plastic market isn’t slowing down, as it’s currently growing at a yearly rate of 5% CAGR and is estimated to be worth over $500B. We believe that to tackle this problem effectively, a simple, scalable solution is required that can treat difficult plastic streams.” (Press release/RAN) Photo below: DePoly co-founders - Christopher Ireland, Samantha Anderson, and Bardiya Valizadeh"

This funding will enable the startup to accelerate its market entry and streamline processes to support the scale-up phase. Reinforced concrete is widely used in large infrastructures such as tunnels, garages, and bridges, as well as in many public and private buildings. However, the service life of reinforced concrete structures is often limited due to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Concrete structures suffering from corrosion must be repaired in order for them to reach their expected service life, but there is currently a lack of knowledge to determine the right time of repair. Founded in 2021, DuraMon AG provides the world’s first sensor technologies and Smart Analytics solution to enable precise and reliable structural health corrosion monitoring for reinforced and prestressed concrete infrastructures. The solution allows for the early detection of deterioration processes and includes data interpretation services to facilitate cost-efficient, resource-efficient, and safe maintenance strategies. Following the competition of its Minimum Viable Product one month after incorporation, the startup secured its first contracts and has since generated growing revenues. The customer base has also continued to grow. The proceeds from the seed round will allow the company to grow through hiring and broaden its customer portfolio. A part of the proceeds will also flow into optimising and automating its operations. “This funding round sets us on a trajectory to thrive during the scale-up phase.

The launch coincides with the closing of a pre-seed investment of CHF 500.000 from angel investors. With purchase prices in some cases higher than the cost of a family home, high-end watches have always been a luxury reserved for the very wealthy. With its co-ownership platform, Elephants , founded by Paolo Catalano and Gianvito Grasso in 2022, is now making this asset class accessible to common people. The watches selected on the platform are unique, vintage and out of production, ensuring their status as rare and iconic. The limited supply of these timepieces leads to a very high demand in the market. How it works: Elephants uses a data-drive approach to select the luxury timepiece Users can buy fractions of the asset When the campaign is completed, Elephants stores the timepiece in a safe location Elephants monitors the market and helps the owners find the best time to sell the watch, the funds are then divided among the owners proportionally Elephants operates in accordance with Swiss regulations and it is affiliated with the SRO SO-FIT. The start-up based at Tecnopolo in Manno (TI) is leveraging the power, protection and traceability of blockchain technology to divide the cost of high-end watches among several owners. The Elephants token is representative only of the ownership right to a fraction of the watch and with the transfer of the token the related ownership right is also transferred. “We’re democratizing opportunities in an asset class historically reserved for the very wealthy.” says Paolo Catalano. “Elephants allows anyone to join an asset class that has outperformed the S&P500 by over 100% over the past seven years.” Gianvito Grasso adds, “The exceptionally high cost of most luxury wristwatches creates a de facto monopoly: these watches are built for the rich, collected by the rich and bought and sold by the rich. Watch enthusiasts and those looking for alternative assets are left out in the cold. We’ve found a way to open the door a little and let some of them in.” The Elephants platform is now available at www.elephantsclub.io and the demand for the first timepiece is already very high.

The funds will be added to the previously raised round to expand the research and development team and validate the risk quantification approach for the insurance, banking, pharmaceutical and high-tech industries. The team is also well equipped to extend the risk quantification to large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Each new business angel joining Calvin Risk 's new pre-seed round is an expert in their respective field. Diana Zur Löwen , for instance, is a marketing, social media, and product placement specialist and will bring this expertise to Calvin as a shareholder. In her LinkedIn post explaining why she invested in Calvin, Zur Löwen stated, ""AI is more than an entertaining trend. Besides the many opportunities it offers, it also poses numerous risks. Especially when companies use algorithms in their processes, it is important to control them. For example, it must be ensured that no minorities (gender bias) are disadvantaged. Calvin Risk’s mission is to enable the risk, management and control of AI algorithms to ensure trustworthy, compliant and responsible use.” Founded by Julian Riebartsch and Syang Zhou , Calvin Risk provides customisable risk management, governance and compliance software for AI algorithms that assesses and manages technical (performance, robustness and security), ethical (fairness, explainability and transparency) and regulatory (accountability, compliance & control) risks to enable secure, transparent, and trustworthy AI. In addition, the tool performs economic impact and profitability analyses on the applications of AI systems. With their solution, Calvin gives large companies in the banking and insurance sectors the means to build a standardised decision-making process for algorithm adoption tied to understandable quality criteria. In addition, this approach allows technical and business stakeholders to connect through a common decision-making framework. The approach is closely related to traditional risk management and model validation but with new modern features such as including different stakeholders in the AI lifecycle. MVP finalised, pilot projects underway With the MVP of its customisable risk assessment and management software for AI algorithms finalised, the team has worked with an international insurance group and on other banking-related projects to validate the solution further. “We have started to conduct extensive business presentations and platform demos in the banking and insurance, high-tech, and the pharma sector to win additional customers”, said Julian Riebartsch to Startupticker. The collaboration partners stem mainly from Europe (including Switzerland and the UK) and the US. Moving forwards, Calvin plans to finetune and validate its risk management tool and methodology on several types of AI algorithms and work on understanding and extending risk assessments to LLMs such as chatbots. “This is still an open research field that has become increasingly important since the emergence of GPT, Bard LLaMA, etc. Many commercial organisations want to use these platforms but are scared of their risks and shortcomings, such as network hallucinations or data leakage,” explains Julian.

The startup has now secured fresh capital to accelerate product development. The signatories management space has been devoid of innovation and a true solution to signatory rights issues within corporate banking. Treasury management globally is a market valued at $4.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to surpass $7.9 billion by 2030. Current solutions have failed to address the needs of corporates seeking a tool that allows them to manage this process on an end-to-end basis that includes easy communication and sharing of information between all their financial counterparts. With its establishment in 2020, Delega introduced a simple and intuitive solution for the market that allows companies to store and manage a central list of current signatory rights fully digitally. This can be shared with chosen banks, ensuring an up-to-date record of signatory information. The platform harnesses secure cloud technology by creating a bank-agnostic single list of currently authorised signatories. Using Delega, companies can give specific banks access to the information needed to create, remove and maintain signatory records. Target customers are mid and large-sized corporations, however, the company intends to penetrate the large and mid-sized banking market. During the third quarter of 2022, Delega launched an EMEA Pilot with key collaboration partners like Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Siemens. Based on the feedback from banks and corporates, the team expanded the features and functions to improve the user experience and enable seamless signatory management. The product is currently on the market. The closed seed financing round resulted in £250,000 (CHF 283.870) raised, with early-stage venture capital firm Jenson Funding Partners as the lead investor. It will enable the startup to advance the development of its multi-bank tool by implementing new features and integrating with value-added services such as e-signature. Riccardo Balasmo, CEO of Delega, says: “Delega is the result of a deep-rooted knowledge of the operational complexities of both Corporate Treasury processes and bank back office processes. Our experienced team of treasury professionals and former transaction bankers is all too familiar with signatory pain points and recognised that a coordinated effort by corporates and banks was needed to truly address the issue. We’ve created a better way to do business – one that leverages digital technologies and a new solution design principle that’s supported by an entirely collaborative approach. Our solution has always kept both ‘sides of the story’ in mind, and it’s what makes Delega unique in responding to the needs of all parties.” Sarah Barber, CEO of Jenson Funding Partners, adds: “Delega is making the entire process for banks and corporations to manage their signatories simpler. The company stood out to us as it offers a clear, concise solution for all parties, with easy access to all the required information to maintain signatory records. It was evident that this was a platform built by treasurers, for treasurers, with the team boasting years of corporate banking knowledge and first-hand experience of the issues companies struggle with every day.

The startup is developing affordable products that can safely slow the ageing process to prevent age-related disease, delay functional decline, and extend life. It currently develops products that evaluate the impact of medicines on ageing using drugs and compounds that have already been approved to treat specific diseases in humans, dogs, and cats. EPITERNA’s innovative platform evaluates medicines that act at the molecular and cellular level in gold-standard animal models of ageing research. The use of small-molecule drugs makes these products more affordable and accessible to a broader audience. The startup has assessed hundreds of medicines in smaller animals and more than a dozen in larger ones, validating promising candidates from the literature and identifying previously unknown leads. Epiterna is currently testing its therapies on organisms from yeast to mice and plans to move onto clinical trials with larger animals, such as dogs, in 2024 in Europe. Alejandro Ocampo, co-founder and CEO of  EPITERNA spent 15 years studying ageing in yeast, and later at the Salk Institute in California where he was one of the first to demonstrate how new therapeutic approaches like epigenetic reprogramming could extend the lifespan of mice.

The company has recently obtained funding from the US-based Duke Impact Investing Group. In response to the alarming increase in mental crisis, Earkick empowers people to measure and improve mental health in real-time. Earkick’s multi-model technology analyzes health markers, vital signs, voice, and sentiment analysis to detect early signs of mental health issues. Based on this proprietary data, Earkick interacts with the individual fully automatedly by proactively providing suggestions and generating personalized content. With this approach, Earkick aims to become a privacy-first digital self-care companion for everyone worldwide. For the technical developments, the team has trained a multi-modal mental sentiment and emotion recognition to recognize mental health states for depression and anxiety. It also built the first “Swiss GPT”, a large language model (LLM) to “talk” to members, providing advice on various levels. Moreover, Earkick can deduct PHQ-9 (a score representing the level of depression of a patient) and GAD-7 (a score representing the level of anxiety of a patient) from the data collected. It can also create synthetic voice data for data augmentation with different moods and anxiety levels, a process that has proven to increase prediction accuracy drastically. The Earkick Selfcare Companion app is already up and running. Karin Andrea Stephan, co-founder and COO, said, “A strategic prototype is out and gaining traction fast while we are developing the full platform.” Earkick currently serves thousands of members across the US, many of them students and young adults. More than 2,000 new members join the Earkick community every month. Earkick impresses US investors Intrigued by the startup’s solution, Zach Beischer, a student and investment analyst at Duke Impact Investing Group (DIIG), contacted the startup expressing his excitement about Earkick’s mission to utilize data in tracking mental health, revealed Karin. ""The students running the Duke Impact Investing Group had done their research, used the Earkick solution and – known for DIIG’s commitment to investing in socially impactful products – they were particularly impressed by the potential of Earkick’s technology to tackle the current global mental health crisis”, she added. DIIG eventually invested an undisclosed amount in Earkick. As the first and only undergraduate-run impact fund at Duke University , DIIG offers more than just financial support to selected ventures; it gives portfolio companies access to top-notch consultants and mentors to help bring their companies to the next level.

Aiming at the future of the creator economy, the startup who joined Fongit this summer is building an ambitious tool for both creators and e-commerce businesses to better connect and achieve amazing success. Swiss media startup Click Analytic focuses on smaller e-commerce businesses that are missing out on influencer marketing opportunities due to insufficient budgets for agencies or expensive tools. The team aims to make influencer marketing more accessible with direct access to first party data and authentic results. A huge industry worth today $104,000,000,000 with 93% of marketers working with creators in 2023. The startup’s founder Paul Boulet worked at several talent management agencies following his Master’s Degree in Sports Marketing from Columbia University. He quickly started working closely with several sports influencers and realized the market potential. In 2019, he created his own agency Click Digital and worked with several clients internationally on both sides of the industry. He was an agent for several micro influencers, helping them manage their careers, relationships with brands and digital strategies. But he was also working with several international DTC (Direct to consumer) brands, where he helped to increase their digital presence, generate content through UGC (user generated content) and manage their relationships with creators and boost their sales Working on +100 campaigns, Paul quickly realized how the whole process was manual and tedious. He would send out +15 emails per creator to launch 1 campaign. It was +30 hours a week spent on content tracking and discovery of profiles. This was the catalyst for the birth of Click Analytic. Moving fast since 2021 With the help of co-founders: Nathan, Jules and Nick, he successfully launched the Click Analytic Beta version in early 2021 and received several pieces of feedback from clients, improving the tool to then launch a V1 in late 2021. Click Analytic innovation resulted in the most advanced and cost effective influencer discovery tool for creator partnerships, with +250M profiles across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. After bootstrapping the business and improving the tool, Click quickly gained traction and generated +100 clients globally, boosting its MRR by 180% in a year. In late 2022 the startup’s goal was to scale its team and be able to support more businesses globally looking to scale their business with creators. Supported by its incubator in Geneva – La Fongit, as well as their two expert coaches Emmanuel de Watteville & John Elbing, the founders worked together on a plan and strategy that would interest investors. Early 2023, the startup got the opportunity to pitch at SICTIC – the largest business angel club in Switzerland. With the additional help of some clients who directly invested in the future of Click Analytic, the team has now closed its pre-seed round. USD 600k have been committed from different strategic investors, business angels, industry experts and institutional investors.

The startup will focus on bringing a more streamlined experience to DTC SMEs, helping them to plug & play their e-commerce statistics and better link them to creator results, but also simplify the whole process of working on an influencer campaign. Its ultimate goal is to create an unified platforms to fully pilot automatically a creator campaign and generate more impactful results.

However, with the solutions provided by the startup, SMEs can automate redundant, dangerous, and non-value-adding parts of their manufacturing lines, allowing human labor to focus on productive activities. This will also enable manufacturers to relocate parts of their production in-house, for better control over their value chain. As the Swiss firm expands its operations, it intends to establish local offices and hire local staff in its clients' countries, which will have a positive impact on the local economy. The investment, led by Spicehaus Partners with the support of High-Tech Gründerfonds and Schaeffler Group , confirms the company's growth potential, as well as the sustainability of its technology and strategic vision.

The artificial intelligence solution from Agtech startup Agrinorm helps fresh produce traders to manage these challenges and improve supply chains. The fresh seed funds will enable the startup to expand its solution to new markets. Started in 2019, Agrinorm addresses some of the most pressing challenges of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. These products deteriorate quickly, and product availability highly depends on weather conditions. Moreover, buyers often place their orders at the last minute and their buying decision changes depending on the current market situation. Managing this uncertainty is challenging and results in food waste. Fresh produce traders thus need to take strategic risks for the continuity of their business while ensuring quality, price, and volume. The Zurich-based startup develops a unique artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help fresh produce traders (customers) manage uncertainties related to product quality and availability. As the first step Agrinorm helps them to set up their quality management system and gather information about customers' preferences and requirements and suppliers' strengths and capabilities in one place. Once data suitable for AI is available, algorithms can help monitor fulfillment risks, track reliability of suppliers, and forecast quality. Ultimately, the solution should help them manage supply chains, grow their margins, provide better returns to the growers, and reduce the environmental footprint of fruits and vegetables. ""There is tremendous potential for applications of AI in fresh produce chains if the right data is available. Agirnorm helps fresh produce companies to capture the right data more efficiently than ever and start using it in decision making"", said Daria Reisch, co-founder and CEO of Agrinorm. “By helping clients prevent food waste, Agrinorm contributes to food security, as well as reducing carbon emissions, which corresponds to SDG 2 ‘Zero hunger’ and SDG 12 ‘responsible consumption’”. Ready for expansion Since launch in October 2021, Agrinorm has had a growing customer base in Europe and Latin America, with further expansion planned. The newly closed seven-digit seed investment round will facilitate this ambition and other planned milestones.

Following positive pilot tests in patients, the startup seeks to obtain a CE certification and FDA approval. The invested CHF 6 million from Swiss company Fumedica and further investors will facilitate the process. Founded in 2014 as a Swiss joint-stock company by renowned heart specialists and engineers, Berlin Heals Holding AG has developed an easily implantable low-invasive microcurrent implantable device called “C-MIC” (Cardiac Microcurrent). The device propagates reverse remodelling of the cardiac muscle tissue by delivering a constant but minimal electrical direct current equivalent to physiological electrical currents in the heart. This results in a sustainable and swift improvement of the texture of heart tissue of heart failure patients. Berlin Heals completed a pilot study (dual center First-in-human studies in Belgrade, Serbia and Vienna Austria) with 10 patients suffering from ‘dilative cardiomyopathy’ in April 2020. So far, over 35 C-MIC devices have been implanted to date, with positive clinical effects - the results showed significant, rapid improvements in heart function, heart size and quality of life of patients. Based on these results, Berlin Heals launched a European-wide CE Study in 2022 while preparing an Early Feasibility Study in the US. The company has already recruited roughly 60% of the required CE patients, and the data generated for CE certification study appears to confirm the initial findings. The Zug-based startup has obtained fresh capital amounting to CHF 6 million to further accelerate the CE certification study. The company expects that 100% of the patients required for the CE certification study will be fully recruited by Q1 of 2024, with respective study results available approximately six months later. The company aims to obtain the CE marking for the C-MIC device thereafter. So far, roughly CHF 35 million have been invested in research, development, and regulatory procedures. “We have initiated the financing round to complete the CE-certification study swiftly and successful”, said Marko Bagaric, Chief Executive Officer, Berlin Heals Holding AG. “We are convinced that Berlin Heals Holding AG’s groundbreaking technology will have a significant impact on heart insufficiency, which remains widespread and a leading cause of death worldwide.” The round attracted new investors, including the Swiss company Fumedica , a special provider in heart surgery and invasive cardiology, as a new investor. According to the company, Fumedica could play an essential role in the initial distribution of the C-MIC in the DACH region. (Press release/RAN)"

The Swiss startup which was able to secure CHF550k in a pre-seed round as well as grants and loans from the Canton de Vaud is poised to become a global platform for collecting, harvesting, and processing data for urban environments. After working together on several projects, founders Elshad Hajiyev and Maxim Interbrick teamed up to analyze the movement patterns of vehicles in the city, particularly taxis. The idea was to use a special algorithm to read the accelerometers of mobile devices to calculate the standard deviation of vibrations and thus measure road quality according to the International Roughness Index (IRI). Surprisingly, the taxis covered the whole city in a remarkably short time and provided enough data to create a map of the roads with the exact GPS location of the irregularities. After contacting MIT, EPFL and other academic circles, it became clear that as well as road quality, air quality, noise exposure and other climate parameters could also vary from street to street, and that there was no way of ensuring compliance without continuous scanning. It was decided to create a network of multi-micro mobile sensors to scan the city and process the data to create high-resolution temporal and spatial maps. Using AI, it is possible to teach machines to track pollution as well as many other parameters, detect possible sources and help the relevant agencies to eliminate them before they have a major effect on human life. This is how the idea of collecting and analyzing Sparrow data came about. Paid pilots, pre-seed round, grants and loans Since its creation in March 2021, Sparrow Analytics is on the fast track. The company has already run more than 10 different paid pilot projects in Switzerland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Israel, and the United States. To create a first-class device, the team needed to set up its own office with a laboratory. For this reason, and to grow as fast as possible, Sparrow was able to raise CHF 550,000, as a pre-seed round, from a member of the SICPA family. Between 2022 and 2023, the start-up received over CHF 350,000 in grants and loans from the Canton de Vaud. As a result, Sparrow has built the most comprehensive, its patent-pending apparatus, laboratory, and algorithms to transform environmental big data into a true analytical product across a wide range of industries: healthcare, insurance, sport, real estate, geo-mapping, engineering, etc. Today, in January 2024, the team has proven its technical and commercial capabilities, as well as its ability to deliver high quality data recognized at the government level as Maxim Interbrick explains: ""From the beginning, ensuring the delivery of reliable data has been a top priority for Sparrow. Unlike some other companies in the microsensor and data delivery space, we have taken significant steps to validate our approach. Our devices and data undergo a rigorous validation and acceptance process alongside government reference stations, which reduces the risk associated with Sparrow's data and ensures that KPIs are properly achieved.""

GeNeuro SA , a pioneer of new therapies for neurology and autoimmune disorders based in Geneva, announced today that it has initiated its planned Phase IIb study with its lead antibody GNbAC1 in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). The study plans to enroll 260 patients in 68 clinical centers in the European Union and Eastern Europe. Preliminary results are expected by the end of 2017. Simultaneous with the start of Phase IIb, development partner Servier has exercised its equity investment option, as part of an agreement signed in November 2014, to become a minority shareholder in GeNeuro by purchasing shares from existing shareholder Eclosion2 . The terms of the partnership agreement provide for GeNeuro to receive US$40 (€37.5) million from Servier for the completion of the Phase IIb study. Subject to exercising its option for a licensing agreement, Servier has agreed to finance the global Phase III development program and pay GeNeuro up to an additional US$355 (€325) million in future development and sales related milestones, as well as royalties on future sales.

Calypso Biotech was formed around Merck Serono’s R&D portfolio in the field of inflammatory bowel diseases, targeting selected niche indications with high unmet medical needs. Merck Serono will invest €2.5 million as seed funding. Merck Serono Ventures will manage the investment and will be represented on the company’s board of directors. “We are pleased that Calypso Biotech will continue promising programs in inflammatory bowel diseases, while Merck Serono focuses its R&D efforts in other therapeutic areas,” said Dr Bernhard Kirschbaum, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Research and Early Development at Merck Serono. “Calypso Biotech has the portfolio, the expertise and the scientific network to build a unique translational medicine approach and to become a partner of choice in this therapeutic area.” Calypso Biotech will start with three Merck Serono employees. The company is founded by Drs. Yolande Chvatchko and Alain Vicari, two seasoned immunologists with strong experience in team management and drug discovery expertise. “Despite the efficacy of current treatments such as anti-TNF therapies, many patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases are experiencing dreadful and sometimes life-threatening complications. In addition, recent changes in our dietary habits have modified the relationships between our immune system and gut microbiota to an extent that we are just beginning to understand, leading to severe pathologies with no treatment options,” said Dr. Yolande Chvatchko, co-founder of Calypso Biotech. “Our portfolio of promising and differentiated therapeutic antibody candidates against validated mechanisms underlying disease progression in several gastrointestinal diseases may be able to address these pathologies which are insufficiently treated by current therapies,” added Dr. Alain Vicari, co-founder of Calypso Biotech.

JSR and Cromacon have entered into a partnership including a minority equity interest in ChromaCon AG by JSR Corporation. As a result of the partnership, the companies started worldwide commercial collaboration activities to promote ChromaCon’s MCSGP and CaptureSMB chromatographic process technologies which are implemented in the Contichrom equipment platform, in providing the biopharmaceutical industry with superior process solutions. The MCSGP process principle, in contrast to classical batch chromatography, allows obtaining a substantial increase in both purity and yield of biopharmaceutical API. The MCSGP with its superior separation capability is particularly suitable for difficult next generation biologics purification challenges including bi-specific & multifunctional antibody drugs, antibody drug conjugates, fusion proteins as well as fragment antibodies. The CaptureSMB process principle allows achieving faster capture step processing, preserving protein integrity and increased economic use of Protein A resins, such as with JSR’s Amsphere Protein-A purification media, specifically designed for fast flow rates. In addition, the commercial collaboration also includes the development of novel chromatography media employing JSR’s polymer chemistry expertise, acting synergistically to further enhance MCSGP separation performance. The Contichrom platform, being marketed by ChromaCon and its equipment partners, is a unique all-in-one process equipment platform, allowing the use of multiple process principles such as batch chromatography, sequential multi column chromatography, CaptureSMB, simulated-moving-bed (SMB) and MCSGP process principle confined to the same equipment. The companies expect that the partnership will accelerate the market expansion of the Contichrom platform which could be an essential tool for enabling the purification of emerging new biologics including biosimilars and biobetters in biopharmaceutical production as well as allowing better and cost-effective processing of current biologics in development and production. JSR aims to utilize this opportunity of the strategic partnership with ChromaCon not only as a leverage to increase the sales of Amsphere Protein-A purification media, but also as a foothold of developing its purification media business extended to the next generation biologics purification. JSR Corporation is a multinational company employing over 5000 people worldwide and a leading materials supplier in a variety of technology driven markets. ChromaCon AG is a private Life Science tool company located in Zürich, Switzerland. The company was founded in 2006 and awarded the CTI Start-up label in 2008."

The investment will give Etihad Airways access to regional markets in Europe, and enable a major expansion of Darwin Airline’s operations. The new ‘Etihad Regional’ logo will be displayed prominently on each side of the fuselage of the Darwin Airline aircraft, while the rear of the plane will carry the words “Operated by Darwin Airline”, and the Darwin Airline’s present logo, as well as continuing to proudly display the Swiss flag. All flights will continue to be operated under the Darwin Airline designator code. By mid-2014, Darwin Airline will add 21 new routes and 18 new destinations.

Groupe E - Number One in electricity distribution in the French-speaking part of Switzerland - and Capital Risque Fribourg SA are joining the company as shareholders. The Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne ( EPFL ) is taking a small participation in connection with the grant of a license for the technology developed by Prof. Grätzel, on which the g2e products are based. CPA Group , a holding company which promotes the development of high-tech industrial companies based at Villaz-St-Pierre (Fribourg canton) will soon complete the shareholding structure of g2e. Strategy confirmed The arrival of these new shareholders validates the g2e strategy by endorsing the choice of the technology invented at the EPFL. This invention holds out the potential for unprecedented applications and design opportunities. The panels developed by g2e are transparent, colored and not sensitive to shade; they are efficient on both sides, even in indoor use, and can be installed vertically. As an example, this enables panels to be placed within the structure of building façades, adding electricity generating function to the glazing fitted in buildings. «The arrival of Groupe E Is a key stage in our development because of its expertise and established position on the electricity market,» Stefan A. Müller, CEO of g2e points out. Philippe Virdis, member of the Groupe E Board and former Chief Executive Officer of that company, has also been elected to join the g2e Board. Apart from the closer ties established with Groupe E, the support given by Capital Risque Fribourg SA, a tool for the economic promotion of the canton which provides financing for innovative companies based in the canton, encouraged the g2e shareholders to approve the transfer of the company to the Vivier Technology Park at Villaz-St-Pierre, near Romont in the autumn of this year. This transfer to a region in which many specialists in the glass industry and in automation are concentrated holds out new opportunities for cooperation, for instance with the highly qualified member companies of the CPA Group or with the Smart Living Lab launched by the EPFL, Fribourg University and School of Engineers and Architects; this laboratory will help to finalize technologies for use in the intelligent buildings of tomorrow. Projects with the academic world The arrival of the EPFL consolidates the natural ties which g2e has maintained since its inception with this institution via the technology for which g2e has developed unique industrial know-how. The cutting-edge competencies developed not only by the EPFL and HEIG-VD at Yverdon-les-Bains but also within Fribourg University and School of Engineers and Architects are of great interest to g2e and will pave the way for further projects. Increased production capacities These developments enable g2e to look forward to 2013 and future years with great optimism. The transfer to Villaz-St-Pierre will enable the company to envisage an increase in its industrial production capacities so as to be in a position to handle incoming orders if the business continues to progress in line with the forecasts. Last April, g2e delivered its first panels to Geneva International Airport (AIG). These panels now equip the balustrades of one of the walkways in the main hall of the airport. Deliveries to further clients are scheduled this summer.

The funds will also help IDQ to continue to develop global markets and partnerships. IDQ has had a long term relationship with SK Telecom. In 2016 the company invested US$ 2 million in IDQ and in 2017 developed the world’s smallest (5x5mm) Quantum Random Number Generator based on technology and know-how licensed from IDQ. As the first South Korean conglomerate to establish a quantum technology laboratory in 2011, SK Telecom has continuously invested in the development of quantum cryptography for wireless communications networks. As part of the transaction, SK Telecom’s quantum laboratory will become part of IDQ. “In the 5G era where everything in the real world is connected wirelessly, the issue of safety will continue to rise,” said Park Jung-ho, CEO and President of SK Telecom. “We will continue our utmost efforts to provide our customers with the world’s safest 5G technology.” “Quantum communications technologies will play a significant role in securing our data and communications, both in backbone networks and at the edge, in an era where the quantum computer will render vulnerable much of today’s cryptography,” added Grégoire Ribordy, CEO and co-Founder of IDQ. “We are proud to work closely with SK Telecom. Partnering with them will allow us to accelerate development of leading-edge solutions to meet these market needs.

The startup has also confirmed NEO Council as a key strategic investor in Valid. Valid is a user-controlled digital identity solution allowing people to transact online securely and seamlessly while safeguarding all their sensitive personal data. Furthermore, the Valid marketplace can directly connect users with data consumers such as product and service companies, brands, researchers and advertisers. With the Valid wallet, users can directly and easily start monetizing their personal data in a fully secure and controlled fashion on the Valid marketplace. In return, data consumers gain direct access to reliable, anonymized data in a compliant and cost-efficient way. Procivis is now taking personal data management to the next level by integrating NEO ’s digital identity protocol, NeoID, with Valid. NEO is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a “smart economy” with a distributed network. Along with the integration comes a strategic investment from the NEO Council, a committee responsible for NEO's long-term development, operation and maintenance and ecosystem. The NEO Council consists of the founding members of the NEO project, under which the management committee, technical committee and the secretariat, respectively, are responsible for strategic decision-making, technical decision-making and specific implementation. Neo as a better fit for Valid NEO’s blockchain infrastructure provides several advantages over existing platforms. For instance, NEO’s consensus protocol, Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance currently permits the network to process up to 1,000 transactions per second with the potential to scale up to 10,000 transactions per second in an energy efficient manner. Valid's CTO Giorgio Zinetti comments: “We believe that blockchain-enabled digital identity solutions need to become a public utility in the future. The underlying infrastructure needs to be able to handle an extensive number of transactions in a cost-efficient way and NEO is already achieving this. However, we need to build a standard that allows projects such as Valid to integrate easily with NEO. Therefore, we look forward to collaborating with the NEO community to establish a respective NEP standard.” Valid is continuously exploring new technologies that could support this vision. The number of blockchains that support smart contracts and are operational still remain limited. The Valid token is currently based on Ethereum’s ERC 20 standard and the identity layer would support Ethereum’s ERC725 and ERC735 protocols. But Valid remains agnostic with regards to the identity protocols supported by its platform and the above reasons make NeoID a highly attractive proposition for Valid. (Press release/ran)"
